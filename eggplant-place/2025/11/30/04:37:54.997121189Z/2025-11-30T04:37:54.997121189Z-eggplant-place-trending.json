This volume introduces the most celebrated authors of antiquity through the lens of Roman history. A vivid description of the city's monuments precedes a prose retelling of the first four books of Virgil's  Aeneid  with many of the most famous passages in their original verse form. The selection from Virgil is followed by book on of Livy's engaging mythical history of Rome's foundation. The prose selections are judiciously chosen and, in the first few chapters, gently adapted to provide students with a text that is authentically Latin and yet not difficult. The unadapted selections, which make up the majority of the text, are taken from Aulus Gellius, Ovid, Nepos, Sallust, and Horace. These annotated selections make  Roma Aeterna  useful both as the next step after  Familia Romana  and as a survey of Latin literature in its own right.\n \n Features include:\n - Latin immersion: Every word, cover to cover, is in Latin with vowel lengths marked.\n - Approximately 3,000 new vocabulary words are taught\n - Each chapter includes a short discussion of grammar an three exercises\n - The original Latin of the most famous lines from the first four books of the  Aeneid \n - Selections from the most celebrated authors of antiquity\n - Helpful margin notes\n - The grammar and vocabulary pick up when  Familia Romana  ends\n - Perfect for home-schoolers, as it covers the material of a course in Roman history\n - Index of Roman rulers and of hitorical events arranged chronologically\n \n The  Indices , available separately, is a supplement which contains lists of the Roman consuls and their triumphs (Fasti consulares and triumphales), as well as name and word indices covering the whole course.

        "brief": "Roma Aeterna  is the second volume of the two-volume series,  Lingua Latina per se Illustrata . This volume introduces the most celebrated authors of antiquity through the lens of Roman history. A vivid description of the city's monuments precedes a prose retelling of the first four books of Virgil's  Aeneid  with many of the most famous passages in their original verse form. The selection from Virgil is followed by book on of Livy's engaging mythical history of Rome's foundation. The prose selections are judiciously chosen and, in the first few chapters, gently adapted to provide students with a text that is authentically Latin and yet not difficult. The unadapted selections, which make up the majority of the text, are taken from Aulus Gellius, Ovid, Nepos, Sallust, and Horace. These annotated selections make  Roma Aeterna  useful both as the next step after  Familia Romana  and as a survey of Latin literature in its own right.\n \n Features include:\n - Latin immersion: Every word, cover to cover, is in Latin with vowel lengths marked.\n - Approximately 3,000 new vocabulary words are taught\n - Each chapter includes a short discussion of grammar an three exercises\n - The original Latin of the most famous lines from the first four books of the  Aeneid \n - Selections from the most celebrated authors of antiquity\n - Helpful margin notes\n - The grammar and vocabulary pick up when  Familia Romana  ends\n - Perfect for home-schoolers, as it covers the material of a course in Roman history\n - Index of Roman rulers and of hitorical events arranged chronologically\n \n The  Indices , available separately, is a supplement which contains lists of the Roman consuls and their triumphs (Fasti consulares and triumphales), as well as name and word indices covering the whole course. A  Latin-English Vocabulary II  is also available.",

        "brief": "Everyone needs to love and be loved\u2014even men. But to know love, men must be able to look at the ways that patriarchal culture keeps them from knowing themselves, from being in touch with their feelings, from loving.\n\nIn The Will to Change, bell hooks gets to the heart of the matter and shows men how to express the emotions that are a fundamental part of who they are\u2014whatever their age, marital status, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. But toxic masculinity punishes those fundamental emotions, and it\u2019s so deeply ingrained in our society that it\u2019s hard for men to not comply\u2014but hooks wants to help change that.\n\nWith trademark candor and fierce intelligence, hooks addresses the most common concerns of men, such as fear of intimacy and loss of their patriarchal place in society, in new and challenging ways. She believes men can find the way to spiritual unity by getting back in touch with the emotionally open part of themselves\u2014and lay claim to the rich and rewarding inner lives that have historically been the exclusive province of women. A brave and astonishing work, The Will to Change is designed to help men reclaim the best part of themselves.",

Na trama, doze anos se passaram desde a ascens\u00e3o de Paul ao trono. Arrakis tornou-se o centro do Imperium, a partir de onde os fremen se propagaram a fim de levar sua filosofia e sua forma de governar aos planetas por eles conquistados. Os inevit\u00e1veis conflitos gerados por esta expans\u00e3o fazem com que importantes fac\u00e7\u00f5es contr\u00e1rias ao imperador re\u00fanam for\u00e7as para det\u00ea-lo. Uma disputa nos bastidores do poder est\u00e1 prestes a come\u00e7ar. Conspiradores tramam contra a atual ordem do Imperium. Conseguir\u00e3o eles acabar com o reinado de Muad'Dib e com a guerra santa que os fremen travam em seu nome?

They each possess their own iconic item: a bow for Low and a wrench for Alone. Working together, they\u2019ve become adept at sneaking through hidden passages, hoisting each other over massive obstacles, and watching each other\u2019s backs. Whether you\u2019re playing with a friend or an A.I. companion, you\u2019ll depend on each other's iconic items to create opportunities and to progress. The environment is full of clues and possibilities for imaginative children to exploit. Low\u2019s arrows can reach high targets, cut through ropes, or down flying enemies, and Alone\u2019s wrench is just the thing for crushing stunned enemies, smashing through barriers, or manipulating the workings of massive machines.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n No matter where you go, the Nowhere is home to horrific monsters. These Residents won't hesitate to go out of their way to capture any intrusive little Visitors that draw their attention. You might find yourself playing a terrifying game of hide and seek with Monster Baby in the sandy ruins of the Necropolis, struggling to avoid swarms of voracious Candy Weevils in an unsetlling Candy Factory, or dodging heavy feet while running along the rain-soaked promenade of a filthy funfair. You'll need to be ready to run, hide, or even defend yourself at a moment's notice to stay in one piece.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n Don\u2019t be too distracted by the desolate beauty of the Nowhere. There are dark mysteries waiting for you as Low and Alone follow their mirror path across the Spiral. As each new location will become more dangerous and disturbing than the last, traumatic flashes from the past will begin to emerge. Will Low and Alone finally escape from this unending nightmare?\n  Only you can help them, little ones... \n \n  ",

This first-person roller-coaster initiated a new era in the history of action games by combining engrossing gameplay, upgraded graphics, ingenious level design and a revolutionary story that may not be all that it seems, told not through cutscenes, but through the visual environment.\n\nDr. Gordon Freeman arrives late for work at 8:47 am in the Black Mesa Research Facility, using the advanced Black Mesa tram system that leads through the facility. He arrives at the Anomalous Materials Lab, his work place, and he is informed by the security officer that the scientists have a special experiment today, so he goes to the locker room and puts on the hazard suit. He goes to the lab's lower levels, and arrives at the Anti-Mass Chamber, where he is instructed that the specimen to be used that day is the rarest and also the most unstable specimen. He is tasked with pushing the specimen into the scanning beam of the Anti-Mass Spectrometer for analysis. However as soon as he pushes it, it explodes, and creates a sudden catastrophe called a \"resonance cascade\", opening a portal between Earth and a dimension called Xen. Freeman is apparently teleported to an alien planet and catches glimpses of various alien lifeforms, including a circle of Vortigaunts, shortly before blacking out."

        "brief": "BioShock Infinite is the third game in the BioShock series. It is not a direct sequel/prequel to any of the previous BioShock games but takes place in an entirely different setting, although it shares similar features, gameplay and concepts with the previous games. BioShock Infinite features a range of environments that force the player to adapt, with different weapons and strategies for each situation. Interior spaces feature close combat with enemies, but unlike previous games set in Rapture, the setting of Infinite contains open spaces with emphasis on sniping and ranged combat against as many as fifteen enemies at once.\n\nBioShock Infinite takes place in the airborne city of Columbia in 1912, where the player assumes the role of Booker DeWitt, a disgraced ex-Pinkerton agent. Booker has been given the job of finding a mysterious and powerful woman imprisoned in Columbia since birth named Elizabeth in order to wipe his debts away, and the story follows the unlikely duo as they journey to escape the flying city while discovering its twisted secrets.",

Roam surroundings high and low, defend against unforeseen threats and solve the mysteries of this unwelcoming place inhabited by curious droids and dangerous creatures. \n  \nSee the world through the eyes of a cat and interact with the environment in playful ways. Be stealthy, nimble, silly, and sometimes as annoying as possible with the strange inhabitants of this mysterious world. \n \nAlong the way, the cat befriends a small flying drone, known only as B-12. With the help of this newfound companion, the duo must find a way out. \n \nStray is developed by BlueTwelve Studio, a small team from the south of France mostly made up of cats and a handful of humans.",

According to The Final Hours of Portal 2, the year is established to be \"somewhere in 2010\"\u2014twelve years after Aperture Science has been abandoned.\n\nThe game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence, about upcoming tests. Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person.[4] Chell is promised cake as her reward if she completes all test chambers.[19]\n\nChell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister; although she is designed to appear encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, tests including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the test. However, GLaDOS declares it must be euthanized in an \"emergency intelligence incinerator\" before Chell can continue.[17] Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled.[20][21]\n\nAfter Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center.[22] GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the \"party escort submission position\", lying face-first on the ground, so that a \"party associate\" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues her escape. In this section, GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center.[11][12] Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem \"The Chariot\", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and Emily Bront\u00eb's \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.[4]\n\nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas. With it removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally, with taunts and juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. Following the announcement of Portal 2, the ending was expanded in a later update. In this retroactive continuity, Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the \"party escort submission position\".[15][23]\n\nThe final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a Black Forest cake,[24] and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. The cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, causing the room to blackout.[25] As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song \"Still Alive\", which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive,[26] that her \"happy\" core was not disabled."

The game contains an open world design and strongly emphasizes exploration due to the world's large size. The game was very well received by critics, with many citing it as a great example of innovation and improvement in Japanese role-playing video games. The game has spawned a sub-series of the larger \"Xeno\" series, including Xenoblade Chronicles X (Wii U) and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (Switch).",

Learn new abilities through the account-wide mastery system and further train your characters with new elite specializations to gain access to new weapons, skills, and traits.\n\nThe story of Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns takes place in the Heart of Maguuma, the deep jungle where Pact forces crashed on their way to confront the Elder Dragon Mordremoth. Discover the secrets of the Maguuma Jungle, meet the new cultures and races who live there, and explore the vastly vertical maps as you progress your characters through this new region.\n\nThe jungle dragon, Mordremoth, is one of six Elder Dragons that threaten all life on Tyria with their corrupting influence and insatiable hunger for magic. Twisted by Mordremoth, the sylvari Scarlet Briar devastated the city of Lion's Arch and disrupted a magical ley line, awakening the dragon. Now it begins to send its minions, the Mordrem, forth to establish its hold on Tyria\u2014and to bring the sylvari race under its control.\n\nYou'll journey through four of the largest, most diverse and replayable maps ever built in the world of Guild Wars; maps in Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns are designed as three-dimensional volumes rather than traditional flat planes.

An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\nTwo expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.\n\nGrand Theft Auto IV follows the story of Niko Bellic, a veteran of an unnamed war in Eastern Europe, who is haunted by the betrayal of his 15 man army unit. Ten years later, after a smuggling run goes bad due to a betrayal from a partner, Niko leaves Eastern Europe to escape the anger of his employer, Ray Bulgarin. After six months in the merchant navy (serving aboard the cargo ship the Platypus), and believing the stories of his cousin Roman, Niko comes to Liberty City to pursue the American Dream as well as searching for the traitor of his unit. After his arrival, however, Niko quickly learns that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loansharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion.",

        "brief": "Grand Theft Auto IV is an action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\nTwo expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.\n\nGrand Theft Auto IV follows the story of Niko Bellic, a veteran of an unnamed war in Eastern Europe, who is haunted by the betrayal of his 15 man army unit. Ten years later, after a smuggling run goes bad due to a betrayal from a partner, Niko leaves Eastern Europe to escape the anger of his employer, Ray Bulgarin. After six months in the merchant navy (serving aboard the cargo ship the Platypus), and believing the stories of his cousin Roman, Niko comes to Liberty City to pursue the American Dream as well as searching for the traitor of his unit. After his arrival, however, Niko quickly learns that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loansharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion.",

As a Vampyr, you are cursed to feed on those you vowed to heal.\n\nWill you embrace the monster within? Survive and fight against Vampyr hunters, undead skals, and other supernatural creatures. Use your unholy powers to manipulate and delve into the lives of those around you, to decide who will be your next victim. Struggle to live with your decisions\u2026 your actions will save or doom London.\n\nVampyr is set in early 20th century Britain as the country is gripped by the lethal Spanish flu and the streets of London are crippled by disease, violence and fear. In a disorganized and ghostly city, those foolish, desperate, or unlucky enough to walk the streets lay prey to Britain\u2019s most elusive predators: the vampires. Emerging from the chaos, a tormented figure awakens. You are Jonathan E. Reid, a high-ranking military surgeon transformed into a vampire upon his return home from the frontline.\n\nExplore the darkly atmospheric streets of early 20th century London, and interact with a multitude of characters with their own identities and importance. Accept and fulfill the missions they give you, but don\u2019t forget: sooner or later, you will have to feed, and make a difficult choice... who will be your prey? Absolutely all characters in the game are potential victims of your vampiric lust. Carefully study the habits of your next victim, his or her relationships with other characters, and set up your strategy to feed, unnoticed: seduce them, change their daily habits, or make sure they end up alone in a dark street...\n\nBe careful who you choose to hunt, as they will be gone forever, and their death will impact in a meaningful way the world that surrounds you. Feeding on human blood will not just keep you \"alive\"; it will also unlock new vampiric powers to use.\n\nThere will be times when exploration and seduction will only get you so far, and you'll need to resort to engaging in Vampyr's dynamic real-time combat. It blends hard-hitting melee combat with ranged shooting mechanics and the supernatural vampire powers. You'll face many types of enemies: different species of vampires and creatures, as well as vampire hunters who want to hunt you down with their weapons, tools and traps. In Vampyr, your health and the \"energy\" that drives your supernatural powers are one and same! Using powers will drain your own blood, giving you an edge in battle but also leaving you weaker. You will have to find a way to feed during combat to replenish your strength.\n\nVampyr also offers a deep crafting system. Find and loot materials and components from the fresh corpses of your victims or during exploration, in order to craft and improve tools, melee and ranged weapons, as well as special ammunitions and coating to exploit the weaknesses of your enemies.\n\nAs you cling to what remains of your humanity, your decisions will ultimately shape the fate of your hero while searching for answers in the coughing, foggy aftermath of the Spanish Flu.",

And again. Forever. NEW BROS Harness the calculating intelligence and acid-spitting allure of Seth Brondle, wield Xebro\u2019s flying Chakram, serenade (and grenade) terrorism with the flamenco firebrand Desperabro, or become the thing monsters have nightmares about, a stake throwing, unholy purging, self-resurrecting teenage Slayer!\n \n If sniping is more your style, famed bug hunter Bro Gummer brings pinpoint liberation with his trusty rifle, while Demolition Bro\u2019s Freeze Grenades put evildoers right back where they belong\u2026 ON ICE. NEW BADDIES A Bro only becomes a force when confronted with those who seek to destroy their freedoms, and in Broforce Forever, the terrorists are even more determined to delete democracy. Motorbike Maniacs will try to run you down, while machine gun placements, barbed wire, sandbags and bazooka-laden blimps conspire to make each visit to occupied territory a very, very bad day at the broffice. NEW CHALLENGES Bros in search of even bigger battles can flex their muscles in new challenge levels known as Muscle Temples. Each campaign tasks Indiana Brones with navigating a perilous temple that features a new Threat Level and specific enemy types and hazards. Succeed and unlock one of four new flexes that can be deployed by any Bro, any time, any place. Just like freedom.\n \n  About the Game When evil threatens the world, the world calls on Broforce - an under-funded, over-powered paramilitary organization dealing exclusively in excessive force. Brace your loins with up to four players to run \u2018n\u2019 gun as dozens of different bros and eliminate the opposing terrorist forces that threaten our way of life. Unleash scores of unique weapons and set off incredible chain reactions of fire, napalm, and limbs in the name of freedom.\n \n     The Broforce Deliver your own brand of shock and awe with dozens of bros each with their own unique weaponry and special attacks designed to dispatch freedom across the world. Bro-Op \u0026 Deathmatch Battle terrorism with up to four players in cooperative mode or sever ties with your bros and face each other in several bombastic competitive modes. Explosion Run Join up with other bros to tackle these unique time attack levels under the pressure of exploding terrains and mass chaos. Fully Destructible Everything Destructible terrain opens up a slew of strategic options while the abundance of Exploding Red Barrels of Justice\u2122 can literally level the playing field with one shot.

        "title": "Batman: Arkham Asylum",
        "description": "Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Released in 2009, it follows Batman as he battles the Joker, who seizes control of Arkham Asylum and frees its inmates. The game features stealth, combat, and detective elements, with players using Batman's gadgets and skills to subdue enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nSet in a dark, immersive version of Gotham, the story explores Batman\u2019s psychological battle with his foes, including Harley Quinn, Bane, and Scarecrow. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay, atmosphere, and storytelling, becoming a defining title in superhero video games.\n\nAfter the Joker assaults Gotham City Hall, he is caught by Batman and taken to Arkham Asylum, which temporarily houses many members of the Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at Blackgate Prison. Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.\n\nThere, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan\u2014a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength\u2014intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths.

            "text": "Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Released in 2009, it follows Batman as he battles the Joker, who seizes control of Arkham Asylum and frees its inmates. The game features stealth, combat, and detective elements, with players using Batman's gadgets and skills to subdue enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nSet in a dark, immersive version of Gotham, the story explores Batman\u2019s psychological battle with his foes, including Harley Quinn, Bane, and Scarecrow. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay, atmosphere, and storytelling, becoming a defining title in superhero video games.\n\nAfter the Joker assaults Gotham City Hall, he is caught by Batman and taken to Arkham Asylum, which temporarily houses many members of the Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at Blackgate Prison. Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.\n\nThere, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan\u2014a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength\u2014intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.\n\nAt the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.\n\nBatman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Joker\u2014who is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it."

        "brief": "Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Released in 2009, it follows Batman as he battles the Joker, who seizes control of Arkham Asylum and frees its inmates. The game features stealth, combat, and detective elements, with players using Batman's gadgets and skills to subdue enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nSet in a dark, immersive version of Gotham, the story explores Batman\u2019s psychological battle with his foes, including Harley Quinn, Bane, and Scarecrow. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay, atmosphere, and storytelling, becoming a defining title in superhero video games.\n\nAfter the Joker assaults Gotham City Hall, he is caught by Batman and taken to Arkham Asylum, which temporarily houses many members of the Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at Blackgate Prison. Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.\n\nThere, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan\u2014a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength\u2014intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.\n\nAt the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.\n\nBatman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Joker\u2014who is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it.",

Mentre la polizia di Gotham City d\u00e0 la caccia al clown killer, la popolazione lo elegge a eroe metropolitano, simbolo della rivolta degli oppressi contro l'arroganza dei ricchi."

I den fjendtlige by Gotham, der emmer af splittelse, g\u00e5r han rundt i de m\u00f8rke gader if\u00f8rt to forskellige masker. Den maske, han dagligt maler p\u00e5 i sit job som klovn, og den anden han aldrig kan tage af. Den er hans forkl\u00e6dning - hans meningsl\u00f8se fors\u00f8g p\u00e5 at passe ind i samfundet i stedet for at v\u00e6re den mand, der gang p\u00e5 gang skuffes af livet. Arthur er faderl\u00f8s, og hans skr\u00f8belige mor er hans bedste ven. Hun gav ham k\u00e6lenavnet Happy. Et navn, der fremmaner hans smil og skjuler smerten indeni. Men da han bliver mobbet af teenagere p\u00e5 gaden, h\u00e5net af forretningsm\u00e6nd i metroen og drillet af hans klovnekollegaer, bringes den udst\u00f8dte mand kun endnu mere ude af synk med alle omkring ham."

Doch das friedliche Leben der Gemeinschaft ger\u00e4t aus den Fugen, als die Armee aus Mesate gewaltsam in die Stadt eindringt, um sich des langlebigen Blutes zu bem\u00e4chtigen.

Maquia ist gl\u00fccklich - doch je \u00e4lter das Findelkind wird, umso bewusster wird sich Maquia, wie ihre Unsterblichkeit nicht nur ihr eigenes Leben beeinflusst \u2026"

Continuing the style developed on her first album Debut (1993), Bj\u00f6rk conceived of Post as a bolder and more extroverted set of songs than its predecessor, featuring an eclectic mixture of electronic and dance styles such as techno, trip hop, IDM, and house, alongside that of ambient, jazz, industrial, and experimental music. Bj\u00f6rk produced Post herself with co-producers including Nellee Hooper, 808 State's Graham Massey, and former Massive Attack member Tricky. She wrote most of the songs after moving to London and intended the album to reflect her new life in the city. ",

        "brief": "In the Wake of Poseidon is the second studio album by English progressive rock group King Crimson, released in May 1970 by Island Records in Europe, Atlantic Records in the United States, Philips Records in Australia, and Vertigo Records in New Zealand. To date the album is their highest-charting in the UK, reaching number 4.\n\nThe album was recorded during a period of instability within the band owing to a fluctuating lineup. It follows a musical style and track sequence very similar to their first album, In the Court of the Crimson King. The album was well-received by contemporary critics, who commended the overall execution and production quality as an improvement over that of the band's debut, although later assessments have faulted its heavy reliance on the template established by its predecessor.

        "description": "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (often shortened to Ziggy Stardust) is the fifth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 16 June 1972 in the United Kingdom through RCA Records. It was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and features Bowie's backing band the Spiders from Mars, composed of Mick Ronson (guitar), Trevor Bolder (bass) and Mick Woodmansey (drums). It was recorded from November 1971 to February 1972 at Trident Studios in London.\n\nDescribed as a loose concept album and rock opera, Ziggy Stardust focuses on Bowie's titular alter ego Ziggy Stardust, a fictional androgynous and bisexual rock star who is sent to Earth as a saviour before an impending apocalyptic disaster. In the story, Ziggy wins the hearts of fans but suffers a fall from grace after succumbing to his own ego. The character was inspired by numerous musicians, including Vince Taylor. Most of the album's concept was developed after the songs were recorded. The glam rock and proto-punk musical styles were influenced by Iggy Pop, The Velvet Underground and Marc Bolan. The lyrics explore the artificiality of rock music, political issues, drug use, sexuality and stardom. The album cover, photographed in monochrome and recoloured, was taken in London outside the home of furriers \"K. West\". ",

The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand, in which a character uses the phrase to refer to execution by electric chair.\n\nAlthough rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. Bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the band and had more input in the songwriting. Beyond the fast tempos of its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It is the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from successor Kirk Hammett.",

Indeed, he is a rare artist whose compositions offer listeners wonder, sadness and pathos in equal measure, and are executed with a precision and effortlessness that eludes most musicians working in the genre. With \u201cKyle Bobby Dunn and the Infinite Sadness,\u201d he has produced what is undoubtedly his most focused and emotionally charged album to date, a rich, expansive collection of slowly unfurling beauty that stretches out over the course of more than two hours. Dunn\u2019s trademark guitar swells and slow-moving loops are present here, but feel clearer and with a renewed sense of purpose and poise. He recorded source material for the album in various Canadian towns, including Belleville and Dorset, and processed and arranged the recordings at L\u2019auberge de Dunn Studios in Montreal while, in his own words, \u201creflecting heavily on the gorgeous feet of a certain French woman and binging on strong beers and cheese.\u201d From the opening salvo, \u201cOuverture de Peter Hodge Transport,\u201d Dunn establishes a haunting, lovelorn trajectory that is developed through pieces such as the strikingly beautiful \u201cBoring Foothills of Foot Fetishville\u201d and the poignant closer \u201cAnd the Day is Dunn and I Can Only Think of You,\u201d titles which exhibit well his trademark sense of (black) humor.
