So-called \u201cgender ideology\u201d\u2014and its supposed dangers\u2014has provoked reactionary backlash across the world. Global networks spread the idea that gender is a dangerous, if not diabolical, ideology threatening to destroy families, local cultures, civilizations\u2014and even \"man\" himself. Inflamed by the rhetoric of religious leaders, politicians, and public figures, this movement has taken aim at the rights of queer and trans people and sought to restrict the freedoms of women, pushing anti-gender legislation and at times perpetuating violence.\nBut what, exactly, is so scary about gender? \n\nIn their monumental book, Butler examines, with characteristic rigor and verve, how \u201cgender\u201d became a convenient catchall boogeyman\u2014a phantasm\u2014for myriad overlapping, and often contradicting, anxieties. From former colonial states in Africa and Asia classifying gender as a Western imposition to the Vatican\u2019s warnings that gender erodes traditional values, Butler powerfully demonstrates how the fears surrounding gender not only are misguided and uninformed but also sow the seeds for authoritarian control and the erosion of public discourse.\n\nAn urgent intervention, a bold call for a freer and more allied world, Who's Afraid of Gender? is a landmark work of social and political analysis that is both timely and timeless\u2014a book only Butler could write.",

        "description": "Uma par\u00e1bola sobre os tempos atuais, por um de nossos maiores pensadores ind\u00edgenas. \n \n Ailton Krenak nasceu na regi\u00e3o do vale do rio Doce, um lugar cuja ecologia se encontra profundamente afetada pela atividade de extra\u00e7\u00e3o mineira. Neste livro, o l\u00edder ind\u00edgena critica a ideia de humanidade como algo separado da natureza, uma \"humanidade que n\u00e3o reconhece que aquele rio que est\u00e1 em coma \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m o nosso av\u00f4\".\n \n Essa premissa estaria na origem do desastre socioambiental de nossa era, o chamado Antropoceno. Da\u00ed que a resist\u00eancia ind\u00edgena se d\u00ea pela n\u00e3o aceita\u00e7\u00e3o da ideia de que somos todos iguais. Somente o reconhecimento da diversidade e a recusa da ideia do humano como superior aos demais seres podem ressignificar nossas exist\u00eancias e refrear nossa marcha insensata em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao abismo.\n \n \"Nosso tempo \u00e9 especialista em produzir aus\u00eancias: do sentido de viver em sociedade, do pr\u00f3prio sentido da experi\u00eancia da vida. Isso gera uma intoler\u00e2ncia muito grande com rela\u00e7\u00e3o a quem ainda \u00e9 capaz de experimentar o prazer de estar vivo, de dan\u00e7ar e de cantar. E est\u00e1 cheio de pequenas constela\u00e7\u00f5es de gente espalhada pelo mundo que dan\u00e7a, canta e faz chover. [...] Minha provoca\u00e7\u00e3o sobre adiar o fim do mundo \u00e9 exatamente sempre poder contar mais uma hist\u00f3ria.\"\n \n Desde seu inesquec\u00edvel discurso na Assembleia Constituinte, em 1987, quando pintou o rosto com a tinta preta do jenipapo para protestar contra o retrocesso na luta pelos direitos ind\u00edgenas, Krenak se destaca como um dos mais originais e importantes pensadores brasileiros. Ouvi-lo \u00e9 mais urgente do que nunca.\n \n  Ideias para adiar o fim do mundo  \u00e9 uma adapta\u00e7\u00e3o de duas confer\u00eancias e uma entrevista realizadas em Portugal, entre 2017 e 2019.",

        "brief": "This book takes examples from around the world, picking through history and anthropology, showing that people have, in different ways and at different times, demonstrated mutual aid, self-organization, autonomy, horizontal decision making, and so forth the principles that anarchy is founded on regardless of whether they called themselves anarchists or not. Too well documented to be strictly mythology, and too expansive to be strictly anthropology, this is an inspiring answer to the people who say that anarchists are a point-by-point introduction to how anarchy can and has actually worked.\n\n[Also available for free at https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-anarchy-works]",

        "description": "In Internet for the People, leading tech writer Ben Tarnoff offers an answer. The internet is broken, he argues, because it is owned by private firms and run for profit. Google annihilates your privacy and Facebook amplifies right-wing propaganda because it is profitable to do so. But the internet wasn't always like this\u2014it had to be remade for the purposes of profit maximization, through a years-long process of privatization that turned a small research network into a powerhouse of global capitalism. Tarnoff tells the story of the privatization that made the modern internet, and which set in motion the crises that consume it today.\n \n The solution to those crises is straightforward: deprivatize the internet. Deprivatization aims at creating an internet where people, and not profit, rule. It calls for shrinking the space of the market and diminishing the power of the profit motive. It calls for abolishing the walled gardens of Google, Facebook, and the other giants that dominate our digital lives and developing publicly and cooperatively owned alternatives that encode real democratic control. To build a better internet, we need to change how it is owned and organized. Not with an eye towards making markets work better, but towards making them less dominant. Not in order to create a more competitive or more rule-bound version of privatization, but to overturn it. Otherwise, a small number of executives and investors will continue to make choices on everyone\u2019s behalf, and these choices will remain tightly bound by the demands of the market. It's time to demand an internet by, and for, the people now.",

From the thirteenth century Free Spirits, to Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, from Noam Chomsky to the Zapatistas, Clifford Harper chronicles, in word and illustration, ordinary people's extraordinary efforts to overcome authoritarian social and economic conditions.\n\nHarper's beautifully rendered drawings add a distinctive elegance to his writings. With entirely new illustrations\u2014over 350\u2014and prose, this handsome reissue can hardly be called a reprint. His celebrated style brings new life to history's forgotten and maligned heroes: the Diggers, William Godwin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Peter Kropotkin, the Grimke Sisters, Francisco Ferrer, Buenaventura Durruti, the Kronstadt sailors, Kenneth Rexroth, Paul Goodman, and Carol Ehrlich. In addition, he addresses anarchism's relationship to broader movements, including art, feminism, environmentalism, abolitionism, labor, intellectualism, atheism, and education.",

Pudiera ser\".\n\nY el brujo cruz\u00f3 la agua y el fuego, sin mirar a su alredor. Pero no se puso botas de yerro ni tom\u00f3 bast\u00f3n. S\u00f3lo llev\u00f3 su espada de brujo. No escuch\u00f3 las palabras de la profetisa. Y bien que hizo, porque era una mala profetisa.",

For the first time in decades, nearly every state in Latin America now asks their citizens to identify their race or ethnicity on the national census. Most observers approvingly highlight the historic novelty of these reforms, but National Colors shows that official racial classification of citizens has a long history in Latin America.\n\nThrough a comprehensive analysis of the politics and practice of official ethnoracial classification in the censuses of nineteen Latin American states across nearly two centuries, this book explains why most Latin American states classified their citizens by race on early national censuses, why they stopped the practice of official racial classification around mid-twentieth century, and why they reintroduced ethnoracial classification on national censuses at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Beyond domestic political struggles, the analysis reveals that the ways that Latin American states classified their populations from the mid-nineteenth century onward responded to changes in international criteria for how to construct a modern nation and promote national development. As prevailing international understandings of what made a political and cultural community a modern nation changed, so too did the ways that Latin American census officials depicted diversity within national populations. The way census officials described populations in official statistics, in turn, shaped how policymakers viewed national populations and informed their prescriptions for national development\u2014with consequences that still reverberate in contemporary political struggles for recognition, rights, and redress for ethnoracially marginalized populations in today's Latin America.",

Davis, a shocking investigation of unparalleled depth into the subversion of the Justice Department over the last decade, culminating in President Donald Trump upending this cornerstone of democracy and threatening America\u2019s rule of law as we have long known it  \n \n Throughout his first administration, Trump did more than any other president to politicize the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency, pressuring appointees to shield him, to target his enemies, and even to help him cling to power after his 2020 election defeat. The department, pressed into a defensive crouch, has never fully recovered. \n \nInjustice exposes not only the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to undermine the department at every turn but also how delays in investigating Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the will of voters under Attorney General Merrick Garland helped prevent the country from holding Trump accountable and enabled his return to power. With never-before-told accounts, Carol Leonnig and Aaron C. Davis take readers inside as prosecutors convulsed over Trump\u2019s disdain for the rule of law, and FBI agents, the department\u2019s storied investigators, at times retreated in fear. They take you to the rooms where Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team set off on an all-but-impossible race to investigate Trump for absconding with classified documents and waging an assault on democracy\u2014and inside his prosecution\u2019s heroic and fateful choices that ultimately backfired. \n \n With a plethora of sources deeply embedded in the ranks of three presidencies, Leonnig and Davis reveal the daily war secretly waged for the soul of the department, how it has been shredded by propaganda and partisanship, and how\u2014if the United States hopes to live on with its same form of government\u2014Trump\u2019s war with the Justice Department will mark a turning point from which it will be hard to recover.\u202fInjustice\u202fis the jaw-dropping account of partisans and enablers undoing democracy, heroes still battling to preserve a nation governed by laws, and a call to action for those who believe in liberty and justice for all.",

Ningu\u00e9m come dinheiro\". Para o l\u00edder ind\u00edgena, civilizar-se n\u00e3o \u00e9 um destino. Sua cr\u00edtica se dirige aos consumidores do planeta, al\u00e9m de questionar a pr\u00f3pria ideia de sustentabilidade, vista por alguns como panaceia.\n\nSe, em meio \u00e0 terr\u00edvel pandemia de covid-19, sentimos que perdemos o ch\u00e3o sob nossos p\u00e9s, as palavras de Krenak despontam como os paraquedas coloridos descritos em seu livro Ideias para adiar o fim do mundo, que j\u00e1 vendeu mais de 50 mil c\u00f3pias no Brasil e est\u00e1 sendo traduzido para o ingl\u00eas, franc\u00eas, espanhol, italiano e alem\u00e3o.\n\nA vida n\u00e3o \u00e9 \u00fatil re\u00fane cinco textos adaptados de palestras, entrevistas e lives realizadas entre novembro de 2017 e junho de 2020, com pesquisa e organiza\u00e7\u00e3o de Rita Carelli.",

        "description": "Always innovative, often provocative, and frequently polarizing, Andrea Dworkin has carved out a unique position as one of the women's movement's most influential figures, from the early days of consciousness-raising to the \"post-feminist\" present. Heartbreak reveals for the first time the personal side of Dworkin's lifelong journey as an activist and a writer. By turns wry, spirited, and poignant, Dworkin tells the story of how she evolved from a childhood lover of music and books into a college activist, embraced her role as an international advocate for women, and emerged as a maverick thinker at odds with both the liberal left and the mainstream women's movement. Throughout, Dworkin displays a writer's genius for expressing emotional truth and an intellectual's gift for conveying the excitement of ideas and words. Beautifully written and surprisingly intimate, Heartbreak is a portrait of a soul, and a mind, in the making.",

Rendeu a Mignola diversos pr\u00eamios Eisner, o \"Oscar\" das hist\u00f3rias em quadrinhos, e inspirou toda uma s\u00e9rie de produtos, como livros, brinquedos, videogames, desenhos animados e dois filmes.\n  \n O sucesso do personagem se repetiu no Brasil. Lan\u00e7ado em 1998, Hellboy logo se tornou um dos mais queridos her\u00f3is da Mythos Editora. Um her\u00f3i que merecia uma cole\u00e7\u00e3o como a que agora apresentamos: HELLBOY EDI\u00c7\u00c3O HIST\u00d3RICA. Em volumes luxuosamente encadernados, esta s\u00e9rie especial atende a um pedido frequente dos f\u00e3s brasileiros, republicando desde o in\u00edcio todas as aventuras do maior investigador paranormal que o mundo j\u00e1 conheceu. \n \n Com enredo e arte de Mike Mignola, e texto do roteirista convidado JOHN BYRNE, Hellboy Edi\u00e7\u00e3o Hist\u00f3rica volume 1: Sementes da Destrui\u00e7\u00e3o re\u00fane os quatro cap\u00edtulos da miniss\u00e9rie de origem do Detetive Sobrenatural. Se voc\u00ea estava ansioso para reviver a trajet\u00f3ria do mais bizarro dos super-her\u00f3is, ou para descobri-la pela primeira vez, esta \u00e9 sua grande chance.",

They each possess their own iconic item: a bow for Low and a wrench for Alone. Working together, they\u2019ve become adept at sneaking through hidden passages, hoisting each other over massive obstacles, and watching each other\u2019s backs. Whether you\u2019re playing with a friend or an A.I. companion, you\u2019ll depend on each other's iconic items to create opportunities and to progress. The environment is full of clues and possibilities for imaginative children to exploit. Low\u2019s arrows can reach high targets, cut through ropes, or down flying enemies, and Alone\u2019s wrench is just the thing for crushing stunned enemies, smashing through barriers, or manipulating the workings of massive machines.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n No matter where you go, the Nowhere is home to horrific monsters. These Residents won't hesitate to go out of their way to capture any intrusive little Visitors that draw their attention. You might find yourself playing a terrifying game of hide and seek with Monster Baby in the sandy ruins of the Necropolis, struggling to avoid swarms of voracious Candy Weevils in an unsetlling Candy Factory, or dodging heavy feet while running along the rain-soaked promenade of a filthy funfair. You'll need to be ready to run, hide, or even defend yourself at a moment's notice to stay in one piece.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n Don\u2019t be too distracted by the desolate beauty of the Nowhere. There are dark mysteries waiting for you as Low and Alone follow their mirror path across the Spiral. As each new location will become more dangerous and disturbing than the last, traumatic flashes from the past will begin to emerge. Will Low and Alone finally escape from this unending nightmare?\n  Only you can help them, little ones... \n \n  ",

Ci sono misteri oscuri che ti aspettano mentre Low e Alone avanzano nella Spirale. Ogni luogo che visiti diventer\u00e0 pi\u00f9 pericoloso e inquietante del precedente e inizieranno a emergere traumatici frammenti dal passato. Riusciranno Low e Alone a fuggire da questo incubo senza fine?\n  Solo tu puoi aiutarli\u2026 \n \n  "

        "brief": " Two young friends, lost in a frightening world not made for children. \n  If they cannot find a way out of this Nowhere place, they\u2019ll be condemned to a fate    worse than death.  \n \n  \n \n You play as Low and Alone, best friends ever since they found each other in this lonely nightmare. They each possess their own iconic item: a bow for Low and a wrench for Alone. Working together, they\u2019ve become adept at sneaking through hidden passages, hoisting each other over massive obstacles, and watching each other\u2019s backs. Whether you\u2019re playing with a friend or an A.I. companion, you\u2019ll depend on each other's iconic items to create opportunities and to progress. The environment is full of clues and possibilities for imaginative children to exploit. Low\u2019s arrows can reach high targets, cut through ropes, or down flying enemies, and Alone\u2019s wrench is just the thing for crushing stunned enemies, smashing through barriers, or manipulating the workings of massive machines.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n No matter where you go, the Nowhere is home to horrific monsters. These Residents won't hesitate to go out of their way to capture any intrusive little Visitors that draw their attention. You might find yourself playing a terrifying game of hide and seek with Monster Baby in the sandy ruins of the Necropolis, struggling to avoid swarms of voracious Candy Weevils in an unsetlling Candy Factory, or dodging heavy feet while running along the rain-soaked promenade of a filthy funfair. You'll need to be ready to run, hide, or even defend yourself at a moment's notice to stay in one piece.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n Don\u2019t be too distracted by the desolate beauty of the Nowhere. There are dark mysteries waiting for you as Low and Alone follow their mirror path across the Spiral. As each new location will become more dangerous and disturbing than the last, traumatic flashes from the past will begin to emerge. Will Low and Alone finally escape from this unending nightmare?\n  Only you can help them, little ones... \n \n  ",

Kratos and Atreus prepare a funeral pyre for her, mourn her death and soon go on a hunt as per Kratos' desire. However much to Kratos' disappointment, Atreus proves his incompetence and lack of focus, making Kratos reconsider taking Atreus in his journey. Kratos is soon attacked by a mysterious stranger with godlike powers, and who cannot feel anything physically.

A ogni connessione infatti, lasciamo una traccia digitale che registra ogni nostra mossa o evento importante, ogni nostra scelta o avversione. Ma ci\u00f2 non riguarda solo le persone. Oggi, tutte le grandi citt\u00e0 sono interconnesse tra loro. Le infrastrutture urbane sono monitorate e controllate da sistemi operativi molto complessi. \n \n In Watch_Dogs, questo particolare sistema \u00e8 chiamato Sistema Operativo Centrale (ctOS) e controlla quasi ogni dispositivo elettronico della citt\u00e0, raccogliendo informazioni sensibili su tutti gli abitanti. \n \n Vesti i panni di Aiden Pearce, un brillante hacker il cui passato criminale ha causato una violenta tragedia familiare.

Non farti catturare facendo sollevare rapidamente un ponte levatoio. Ogni elemento collegato al ctOS della citt\u00e0 pu\u00f2 diventare la tua arma migliore.\n \n  GIUSTIZIA BRUTALE \n Vivendo in una citt\u00e0 come Chicago, dove alla violenza si risponde con altra violenza, devi essere in grado di sopravvivere e lottare.

        "brief": "All it takes is the swipe of a finger. We connect with friends. We buy the latest gadgets and gear. We find out what\u2019s happening in the world. But with that same simple swipe, we cast an increasingly expansive shadow. With each connection, we leave a digital trail that tracks our every move and milestone, our every like and dislike. And it\u2019s not just people. Today, all major cities are networked. Urban infrastructures are monitored and controlled by complex operating systems. \n \nIn Watch_Dogs, this system is called the Central Operating System (CTOS) \u2013 and it controls almost every piece of the city\u2019s technology and holds key information on all of the city\u2019s residents.  \n \nYou play as Aiden Pearce, a brilliant hacker and former thug, whose criminal past led to a violent family tragedy.  Now on the hunt for those who hurt your family, you'll be able to monitor and hack all who surround you by manipulating everything connected to the city\u2019s network. Access omnipresent security cameras, download personal information to locate a target, control traffic lights and public transportation to stop the enemy\u2026and more. \n \n Use the city of Chicago as your ultimate weapon and exact your own style of revenge. \n\nKEY FEATURES \n  \nHACK THE CITY \n Watch_Dogs takes place in a fully simulated living city where, using your smartphone, you have real-time control over the city\u2019s infrastructure.  Trap your enemy in a 30-car pileup by manipulating the traffic lights. Stop a train, and then board it to evade the authorities. Narrowly escape capture by quickly raising a drawbridge. Anything connected to the city\u2019s CTOS can become your weapon.\n \n  STREET JUSTICE \n Living in inner city Chicago where violence is best answered by violence, you have the skills to take the fight to the streets. Take down enemies by delivering devastating blows with your baton, or experience a shoot-out like never before with a physics simulation that rivals anything in the shooter category. Use a combination of shooting and hacking to gain advantage in any given situation.  The streets are designed for you to create your own plan of attack. Overall, you will have access to more than 30 traditional weapons. \n \n  HIGH OCTANE DRIVING \n Ubisoft Montreal has partnered with studios such as Ubisoft Reflections, the acclaimed studio behind the award-winning Driver series to bring you a game bursting with horsepower. Get behind the wheel of more than 65 vehicles, each with state of the art physics and handling, and explore the massive city while completing missions.\n \t\n  EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL  \n Disrupt, the all-new game engine dedicated to Watch_Dogs, uses advanced processing and graphics to deliver a stunning visual and an incredibly realistic experience. Disrupt gives you the power to affect the story, the city and the life of the population with your choices creating a ripple effect throughout the city.\n \n  DYNAMIC NAVIGATION \n Watch_Dogs gives you the ability to not only use the city\u2019s ctOS to your advantage, but the streets as well. In real-world Chicago, cut through buildings or climb to the rooftops to catch your target.\n \n  SEAMLESS MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE \n Discover new levels of interaction, cooperation and confrontation between players thanks to a brand new multiplayer game system that links the single and multiplayer modes into one seamless experience. That means no menus, no loading screens, just instant open world multiplayer action.",

            "text": "1998. HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling.\n\nNOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.\n\nGordon Freeman is brought out of stasis by the G-Man, who inserts him into a train arriving at City 17. After arriving at the station and eluding Combine forces, Gordon joins Lambda resistance members including Barney Calhoun, a former Black Mesa security guard now working undercover as a Combine CP officer, and Alyx Vance, the daughter of one of Gordon's former colleagues, Dr. Eli Vance. After a failed attempt to teleport Gordon to Black Mesa East from Dr. Kleiner's makeshift laboratory, Gordon, re-equipped with the HEV suit and a crowbar, is forced to embark on foot through the city's old canal system. After obtaining an airboat, he battles his way to Black Mesa East, several miles from the city.\n\nGordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets Dr. Judith Mossman. Alyx introduces Gordon to her large pet robot D0g and gives him a \"Gravity Gun\", a weapon which allows Gordon to pick up and move any large object with ease. Black Mesa East soon comes under Combine attack and Eli and Mossman are captured to be taken to a Combine prison, Nova Prospekt. Gordon and Alyx are forced to take separate paths to Nova Prospekt; Gordon takes a detour through the town of Ravenholm, receiving help from its last survivor, Father Grigori. After making his way through the town and a mine, Gordon makes his way to a Resistance outpost. Gordon is provided with a Dune Buggy, which he uses to travel along a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt. Along the way, Gordon encounters frequent Combine patrols, and helps one of the resistance leaders, Colonel Odessa Cubbage, to defend a Resistance base from a Combine gunship.\n\nAfter crossing an antlion-infested beach, Gordon enters Nova Prospekt, where he is reunited with Alyx. They manage to locate Eli, but also discover that Mossman is a Combine informant. Before they can stop her, she teleports herself and Eli back to City 17's Citadel. The Combine teleporter explodes as Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt.\n\nUpon reaching Kleiner's lab, a shaken Dr. Kleiner reveals to Gordon and Alyx that they were caught in a \"slow teleport\", during which a week had passed. In their absence, the Resistance, who heard about what had happened at Nova Prospekt, has mobilized against the Combine, turning City 17 into a battleground. During the fighting, Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel, and Gordon fights through the city with the aid of D0g and Barney to reach it. Inside the Citadel, he is caught in a Combine confiscation chamber that destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun, the energy enhancing its capabilities and allowing Gordon to escape and dispatch platoons of Combine soldiers.\n\nEventually, Gordon is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office, where he and Dr. Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx in captivity. Dr. Breen begins to explain his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine, contrary to what he had told Dr. Mossman. Angered, Mossman frees Gordon, Alyx, and Eli before Breen teleports them off-world. Dr. Breen tries to escape through a portal, but Gordon pursues him and destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen appears to be annihilated in the resulting explosion.\n\nJust before Gordon and Alyx are presumably met with a similar fate, time is frozen. The G-Man reappears, praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel. Making vague mention of \"offers for [Gordon's] services\", the G-Man places him back into stasis."

This first-person roller-coaster initiated a new era in the history of action games by combining engrossing gameplay, upgraded graphics, ingenious level design and a revolutionary story that may not be all that it seems, told not through cutscenes, but through the visual environment.\n\nDr. Gordon Freeman arrives late for work at 8:47 am in the Black Mesa Research Facility, using the advanced Black Mesa tram system that leads through the facility. He arrives at the Anomalous Materials Lab, his work place, and he is informed by the security officer that the scientists have a special experiment today, so he goes to the locker room and puts on the hazard suit. He goes to the lab's lower levels, and arrives at the Anti-Mass Chamber, where he is instructed that the specimen to be used that day is the rarest and also the most unstable specimen. He is tasked with pushing the specimen into the scanning beam of the Anti-Mass Spectrometer for analysis. However as soon as he pushes it, it explodes, and creates a sudden catastrophe called a \"resonance cascade\", opening a portal between Earth and a dimension called Xen. Freeman is apparently teleported to an alien planet and catches glimpses of various alien lifeforms, including a circle of Vortigaunts, shortly before blacking out."

The episode takes place immediately after the end of Half-Life 2, in the war-torn setting of City 17. The player is forced to deal with the effects of their actions during the main game. The episode is a stand-alone game; while a continuation of Half-Life 2, it does not require the original game to be installed or registered to a user's Steam account to play. It takes advantage of several major upgrades to the Source engine since the release of Half-Life 2, primarily its high dynamic range rendering capabilities and the upgraded facial animation system.\n\nEpisode One was released together with Half-Life Deathmatch: Source, a port of the original Half-Life's multiplayer, which doubles as Episode One's multiplayer component. The retail copies of Episode One also come with Half-Life 2 Deathmatch for those who have not previously purchased the later title.\n\nTaking place in City 17, just after the events of the last game, Half-Life 2: Episode one again follows scientist Gordon Freeman and his friend Alyx Vance as they stabilize a damaged Citadel core to buy time before it explodes, which will destroy the city and the surrounding area. They then rush to make it out of a war-torn City 17 as quickly as possible and also help evacuate any remaining citizens left."

According to The Final Hours of Portal 2, the year is established to be \"somewhere in 2010\"\u2014twelve years after Aperture Science has been abandoned.\n\nThe game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence, about upcoming tests. Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person.[4] Chell is promised cake as her reward if she completes all test chambers.[19]\n\nChell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister; although she is designed to appear encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, tests including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the test. However, GLaDOS declares it must be euthanized in an \"emergency intelligence incinerator\" before Chell can continue.[17] Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled.[20][21]\n\nAfter Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center.[22] GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the \"party escort submission position\", lying face-first on the ground, so that a \"party associate\" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues her escape. In this section, GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center.[11][12] Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem \"The Chariot\", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and Emily Bront\u00eb's \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.[4]\n\nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas. With it removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally, with taunts and juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. Following the announcement of Portal 2, the ending was expanded in a later update. In this retroactive continuity, Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the \"party escort submission position\".[15][23]\n\nThe final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a Black Forest cake,[24] and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. The cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, causing the room to blackout.[25] As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song \"Still Alive\", which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive,[26] that her \"happy\" core was not disabled."

You will become one of them.\n\nBy fate or fortune, you survive when the nautiloid crashes in the Sword Coast outlands. You set out for civilisation, desperate for a cure for the parasite festering in your brain, only to take centre stage in a conspiracy that runs as deep as the Nine Hells.

        "description": "Fallout 3 from the creators of the award-winning Oblivion, featuring one of the most realized game worlds ever created. Create any kind of character you want and explore the open wastes of post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. Every minute is a fight for survival as you encounter Super Mutants, Ghouls, Raiders and other dangers of the Wasteland. Prepare for the future.\n\nThe third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time.\n\nThe introductory sequence introduces the player to their character's father James, a doctor and scientist in Vault 101. James frequently makes comments about the player character's deceased mother Catherine, and her favorite Bible passage, Revelation 21:6, which speaks of \"the waters of life\".\n\nThe main quest begins after the player is forced to flee Vault 101 when James leaves the vault, throwing it into anarchy and causing the paranoid Overseer to send his security force after the player. The search for James takes the character on a journey through the Wasteland, first to the nearby town of Megaton, named for the undetonated atomic bomb at the center of town, then the Galaxy News Radio station, whose enthusiastic DJ Three Dog gives the player the moniker of \"The Lone Wanderer\". The player travels to Rivet City, a derelict aircraft carrier now serving as a fortified human settlement. Here the player meets Doctor Li, a scientist who worked alongside the player's father. Doctor Li informs the player of Project Purity, a plan conceived by Catherine and James to purify all the water in the Tidal Basin and eventually the entire Potomac River with a giant water purifier built in the Jefferson Memorial. However, continued delays and Catherine's death during childbirth put an end to the project, and James took the player's character as a newborn to raise them in the safety of Vault 101.\n\nAfter investigating the Jefferson Memorial, the Lone Wanderer tracks James to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Braun. James and the player return to Rivet City, and James reveals he sought out Braun for information on the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), a device that contains the components needed to finally activate Project Purity. James and Doctor Li lead a team of Rivet City scientists to the memorial with intent to restart the project, but the memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from the remnants of the pre-War United States government. James floods the project's control room with radiation to stop the Enclave military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it, killing himself (but Autumn survives), his last words urging his child to run. The Lone Wanderer and Dr. Li flee to the ruins of the Pentagon, now a base for the Brotherhood of Steel and now known as the Citadel.\n\nWith Project Purity still inoperable even with the Enclave occupying the site, the player travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K. and finish James's work. The player finds the Vault to be a testing site for the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), and the source of the Super Mutants in the Capital Wasteland. After the player acquires the G.E.C.K., the Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave and captured.\n\nAt the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the player is freed from their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry Eden, who requests a private audience with them. En route to his office however, Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders and takes command of the Enclave military, ordering them to kill the player. Fighting their way to Eden's office, the player discovers Eden is actually a sentient ZAX series supercomputer who took control of the Enclave after their defeat in Fallout 2 on the West Coast thirty years ago. Eden wishes to repeat the plan of then-President Dick Richardson using Project Purity, infecting the water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life. This plan will kill most life in the wasteland including humans, but the Enclave, due to their genetic \"purity\" as a result of their isolation, will be immune and free to take control of the area. The Wanderer, provided with a sample of the new F.E.V., is given a choice to either leave peacefully or convince Eden to self-destruct the entire base. The Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock and returns to the Citadel.\n\nWith the knowledge they possess, the G.E.C.K. and the means to activate Project Purity, the Brotherhood assault the Jefferson Memorial, spearheaded by a giant robot named Liberty Prime. In the control room of Project Purity the player confronts Colonel Autumn, and has the choice to persuade him to give up or kill him. Dr. Li informs the player that the purifier is ready to be activated, but the activation code must be input manually, and also that the control room is flooded with lethal amounts of radiation. The Lone Wanderer is forced to choose between sending Sarah Lyons of the Brotherhood inside the extremely irradiated purifier or entering themselves. Whoever enters into the chamber inputs the code hinted at through the game, that being 21:6, and dies from a radiation spike.",

        "brief": "Fallout 3 from the creators of the award-winning Oblivion, featuring one of the most realized game worlds ever created. Create any kind of character you want and explore the open wastes of post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. Every minute is a fight for survival as you encounter Super Mutants, Ghouls, Raiders and other dangers of the Wasteland. Prepare for the future.\n\nThe third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time.\n\nThe introductory sequence introduces the player to their character's father James, a doctor and scientist in Vault 101. James frequently makes comments about the player character's deceased mother Catherine, and her favorite Bible passage, Revelation 21:6, which speaks of \"the waters of life\".\n\nThe main quest begins after the player is forced to flee Vault 101 when James leaves the vault, throwing it into anarchy and causing the paranoid Overseer to send his security force after the player. The search for James takes the character on a journey through the Wasteland, first to the nearby town of Megaton, named for the undetonated atomic bomb at the center of town, then the Galaxy News Radio station, whose enthusiastic DJ Three Dog gives the player the moniker of \"The Lone Wanderer\". The player travels to Rivet City, a derelict aircraft carrier now serving as a fortified human settlement. Here the player meets Doctor Li, a scientist who worked alongside the player's father. Doctor Li informs the player of Project Purity, a plan conceived by Catherine and James to purify all the water in the Tidal Basin and eventually the entire Potomac River with a giant water purifier built in the Jefferson Memorial. However, continued delays and Catherine's death during childbirth put an end to the project, and James took the player's character as a newborn to raise them in the safety of Vault 101.\n\nAfter investigating the Jefferson Memorial, the Lone Wanderer tracks James to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Braun. James and the player return to Rivet City, and James reveals he sought out Braun for information on the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), a device that contains the components needed to finally activate Project Purity. James and Doctor Li lead a team of Rivet City scientists to the memorial with intent to restart the project, but the memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from the remnants of the pre-War United States government. James floods the project's control room with radiation to stop the Enclave military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it, killing himself (but Autumn survives), his last words urging his child to run. The Lone Wanderer and Dr. Li flee to the ruins of the Pentagon, now a base for the Brotherhood of Steel and now known as the Citadel.\n\nWith Project Purity still inoperable even with the Enclave occupying the site, the player travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K. and finish James's work. The player finds the Vault to be a testing site for the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), and the source of the Super Mutants in the Capital Wasteland. After the player acquires the G.E.C.K., the Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave and captured.\n\nAt the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the player is freed from their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry Eden, who requests a private audience with them. En route to his office however, Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders and takes command of the Enclave military, ordering them to kill the player. Fighting their way to Eden's office, the player discovers Eden is actually a sentient ZAX series supercomputer who took control of the Enclave after their defeat in Fallout 2 on the West Coast thirty years ago. Eden wishes to repeat the plan of then-President Dick Richardson using Project Purity, infecting the water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life. This plan will kill most life in the wasteland including humans, but the Enclave, due to their genetic \"purity\" as a result of their isolation, will be immune and free to take control of the area. The Wanderer, provided with a sample of the new F.E.V., is given a choice to either leave peacefully or convince Eden to self-destruct the entire base. The Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock and returns to the Citadel.\n\nWith the knowledge they possess, the G.E.C.K. and the means to activate Project Purity, the Brotherhood assault the Jefferson Memorial, spearheaded by a giant robot named Liberty Prime. In the control room of Project Purity the player confronts Colonel Autumn, and has the choice to persuade him to give up or kill him. Dr. Li informs the player that the purifier is ready to be activated, but the activation code must be input manually, and also that the control room is flooded with lethal amounts of radiation. The Lone Wanderer is forced to choose between sending Sarah Lyons of the Brotherhood inside the extremely irradiated purifier or entering themselves. Whoever enters into the chamber inputs the code hinted at through the game, that being 21:6, and dies from a radiation spike.",

        "description": "As Lara Croft races to save the world from a Maya apocalypse, she must become the Tomb Raider she is destined to be.\n\nIn the two months since Rise of the Tomb Raider, Lara Croft and her friend Jonah Maiava have dedicated themselves to stopping the activities of paramilitary organization Trinity. The two track a cell to Cozumel in Mexico that is led by Pedro Dominguez, the head of Trinity's High Council. Slipping inside nearby tombs being excavated by Trinity, Lara discovers a temple containing the Dagger of Chak Chel and references to a hidden city. Murals adorning the walls allude to the Silver Box of Ix Chel and warn of \"the Cleansing\", a Mayan apocalypse culminating in a permanent solar eclipse. Lara ignores the warnings and takes the Dagger to prevent Trinity from acquiring it. Dominguez catches her and reveals that by taking the Dagger, Lara has triggered the Cleansing. He takes the Dagger, intending to unite it with the Box to stop the Cleansing and use the power it grants him to remake the world in his image. Lara and Jonah escape a tsunami that destroys Cozumel and foreshadows the coming apocalypse.\nDespite growing tensions between them over her actions, Lara and Jonah pursue Dominguez into the Amazon. Their plane crashes in the Peruvian jungle during the second cataclysm\u2014a massive storm\u2014and the two find their way to Paititi, the hidden city shown in the murals. Exploring local tombs reveals that piercing the Box with the Dagger will grant the user the power of the god Kukulkan, which must be used to halt the Cleansing. Lara witnesses Trinity soldiers being slaughtered by strange humanoid monsters later identified as the Yaaxil, guardians of the Box. When Lara saves a boy named Etzli, she and Jonah are brought into Paititi by his mother Unuratu, queen of the city. Lara sees Dominguez is the leader of a cult dedicated to Kukulkan and Unuratu reveals he is her brother-in-law Amaru, who was taken by Trinity as a child and raised to complete the ritual and reshape the world in their image. Unuratu directs Lara to the Box, but Lara finds it is missing. Believing the cult already has the Box, Lara, and Unuratu attempt to steal it, but Unuratu is captured. Lara also encounters the Yaaxil and their leader Crimson Fire.\nLara infiltrates the cult's temple and overhears Amaru telling Unuratu that the Box was hidden by Andres Lopez, a missionary sent to Paititi by Trinity during the Spanish conquest of South America. Lara rescues Unuratu and realizes that Amaru does not fully understand the ritual; rather than merely imbuing Kukulkan's power, the ritual sacrifices it to stop the Cleansing. Unuratu is shot by Commander Rourke, Amaru's second in command. Before she dies, Unuratu implores Lara to complete the ritual but warns her not to let the Box influence her. Rourke attacks Lara and Jonah, who are separated as they leave Paititi to decipher the next clue. Thinking Jonah dead, Lara goes on a rampage that destroys an oil refinery and slaughters everyone there except Rourke, who escapes. She momentarily breaks down when she finds Jonah alive, but he manages to calm her, and they decipher the Box's location. Driven mad by the Box, Lopez established a mission near Paititi where he trained acolytes to complete the ritual. Lara and Jonah find a secret catacomb beneath the missiong leading to Lopez's tomb and the Box. Amaru finds them and forces Lara to surrender the Box. He admits that he ordered her father's death to prevent him from finding Paititi and revealing it to the world. Lara tries to persuade Amaru to use the ritual to benefit the world. He refuses, as the Cleansing will only affect Paititi. Amaru has used his position in Trinity to manipulate them into preventing it. He leaves Lara and Jonah to escape the third cataclysm, a massive earthquake that causes a landslide and destroys the mission.\nBack in Paititi, Lara and Jonah help the newly-crowned Etzli lead an assault on an underground temple complex at Paititi's center. They plan to disrupt Amaru's ceremony while avoiding the fourth cataclysm, a volcanic eruption threatening Paititi. Lara is forced to go on alone when Trinity cuts off Etzli's forces. She encounters the Yaaxil and Crimson Fire, convincing them to help her stop Amaru. Lara takes on the symbolic role of Ix Chel while Crimson Fire becomes Chak Chel. While the Yaaxil kill Rourke and the Trinity High Council, Lara makes it to the temple summit. She fails to stop Amaru from piercing the Box and absorbing Kukulkan's power as an eclipse blocks the sun. Lara overpowers Amaru after a lengthy battle; accepting defeat, he transfers Kukulkan's power to Lara as he dies. True to Unuratu's warning, she is tempted to use the Box to revive her parents, but instead lets Crimson Fire symbolically stab her, sacrificing Kukulkan's spirit and stopping the Cleansing. In the aftermath, Unuratu is laid to rest, and Jonah decides to take a vacation. Lara stays in Paititi to help Etzli restore the city to its former glory. A post-credits scene shows Lara planning her next adventure at Croft Manor, acknowledging that her role is not to solve the world's mysteries, but to protect them.",

The player's character begins on a sand dune in a seemingly endless desert. In the far distance looms a large, foreboding mountain with a glowing crevice that splits its peak. As the character approaches the mountain, they find remnants of a once-thriving civilization, eroded by sand over time.

Eventually making it safely to the mountain, the traveler begins to climb it, struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds. With the crevice still a fair distance away, the traveler falls and collapses in the snow. Six of the white-robed figures appear and grant the traveler new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into and through the crevice as the screen fills with white. The player is then shown the game's credits, playing over the ending cinematic. This cinematic shows a shooting star emanating from the crevice and traversing the path the traveler took through the ruins, and shows glimpses of other robed travelers heading towards the mountain. Eventually, the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began, and the player is given the option of starting the game again.

        "description": "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (often shortened to Ziggy Stardust) is the fifth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 16 June 1972 in the United Kingdom through RCA Records. It was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and features Bowie's backing band the Spiders from Mars, composed of Mick Ronson (guitar), Trevor Bolder (bass) and Mick Woodmansey (drums). It was recorded from November 1971 to February 1972 at Trident Studios in London.\n\nDescribed as a loose concept album and rock opera, Ziggy Stardust focuses on Bowie's titular alter ego Ziggy Stardust, a fictional androgynous and bisexual rock star who is sent to Earth as a saviour before an impending apocalyptic disaster. In the story, Ziggy wins the hearts of fans but suffers a fall from grace after succumbing to his own ego. The character was inspired by numerous musicians, including Vince Taylor. Most of the album's concept was developed after the songs were recorded. The glam rock and proto-punk musical styles were influenced by Iggy Pop, The Velvet Underground and Marc Bolan. The lyrics explore the artificiality of rock music, political issues, drug use, sexuality and stardom. The album cover, photographed in monochrome and recoloured, was taken in London outside the home of furriers \"K. West\". ",

        "brief": "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (often shortened to Ziggy Stardust) is the fifth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 16 June 1972 in the United Kingdom through RCA Records. It was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and features Bowie's backing band the Spiders from Mars, composed of Mick Ronson (guitar), Trevor Bolder (bass) and Mick Woodmansey (drums). It was recorded from November 1971 to February 1972 at Trident Studios in London.\n\nDescribed as a loose concept album and rock opera, Ziggy Stardust focuses on Bowie's titular alter ego Ziggy Stardust, a fictional androgynous and bisexual rock star who is sent to Earth as a saviour before an impending apocalyptic disaster. In the story, Ziggy wins the hearts of fans but suffers a fall from grace after succumbing to his own ego. The character was inspired by numerous musicians, including Vince Taylor. Most of the album's concept was developed after the songs were recorded. The glam rock and proto-punk musical styles were influenced by Iggy Pop, The Velvet Underground and Marc Bolan. The lyrics explore the artificiality of rock music, political issues, drug use, sexuality and stardom. The album cover, photographed in monochrome and recoloured, was taken in London outside the home of furriers \"K. West\". ",

        "brief": "In the Wake of Poseidon is the second studio album by English progressive rock group King Crimson, released in May 1970 by Island Records in Europe, Atlantic Records in the United States, Philips Records in Australia, and Vertigo Records in New Zealand. To date the album is their highest-charting in the UK, reaching number 4.\n\nThe album was recorded during a period of instability within the band owing to a fluctuating lineup. It follows a musical style and track sequence very similar to their first album, In the Court of the Crimson King. The album was well-received by contemporary critics, who commended the overall execution and production quality as an improvement over that of the band's debut, although later assessments have faulted its heavy reliance on the template established by its predecessor.

The Body, Lee Buford and Chip King, continually challenge any conventional conception of metal, collaborating with myriad artists and from the folk-leanings of their work with BIG|BRAVE to their groundbreaking work with the Assembly of Light Choir to the intensity of their collaborations with OAA or Thou. Dis Fig, aka Felicia Chen, pushes electronic music into dark extremes, from warped DJ sets to avant production, from being a member of Tianzhuo Chen\u2019s performance-art series TRANCE to being the vocalist with The Bug. The Body and Dis Fig find kinship in reimagining what it means to make \u201cheavy music\u201d. Their debut Orchards of a Futile Heaven is the perfect synthesis of two forces, twisting melodicism and intoxicating rhythms, layering a dense miasma of distortion with intense beats and a soaring voice clawing its way towards absolution.\n\n\n\nOrchards of a Futile Heaven\u2019s walls of sputtering texture and tectonic booms are soaked in the reverence and melancholy of sacred spaces brought to life by palpable intensity by Chen\u2019s voice. Crafted during a time of personal fragility, the album\u2019s devastating force lies beyond any of the expected noise and abrasive textures typically associated with both The Body \u0026 Dis Fig. Suffused with a raw vulnerability and a longing for catharsis, Chen\u2019s voice searches for escape in the midst of oppressive atmospheres as if determined to find relief from guilt. \u201cEternal Hours\u201d patiently unfurls waves of surprising sounds, whispered undulations that are punctuated by sudden crashes, all beneath Chen\u2019s haunting harmonies. \u201cDissent, Shame\u201d evokes grief and shame with a minimalist drone dirge that gradually builds to an enchanting choral passage. King\u2019s guitar on \u201cHoly Lance\u201d matches the uncanny drone of Chen\u2019s accordion in an all-consuming blast, Chen\u2019s voice transforming the moment from anguish to defiance and empowerment. The album\u2019s arc finishes with \u201cCoils of Kaa\u201d acting as a kind of propulsive exorcism, breaking through a suffocating air before the funeral procession of \u201cBack to the Water\u201d lays the album to rest.\n\n\n\nWhile sampling has long been essential to each, The Body \u0026 Dis Fig deftly meld their differing approaches to sampling and creating extreme sounds until the boundaries are entirely blurred. The two found kinship in their desire to find new avenues to make heavy music that looked beyond tropes of metal and electronic music by merging the two. \u201cI always wanted the heavier stuff but I also didn\u2019t really like heavier guitar music,\u201d says Buford. \u201cNone of it really felt quite heavy enough to me. A human can\u2019t be as heavy as a machine.\u201d Chen counters, \u201cI love the balance. You could never connect to just a machine as well as you could a human. Which is why the combination is so potent for me. I don\u2019t want to hide. I think nothing connects you more empathetically than another human's voice.\u201d\n\n\n\nOrchards of a Futile Heaven affirms The Body \u0026 Dis Fig as skilled sound sculptors who have an exceptional ability to make deeply affecting music, bracing as it is touching, harrowing as it is awe-inspiring. Together, the two have harnessed their expansive artistry to make music that is profoundly emotional, and staggering in its beauty.",

Dalla fronte del ragazzo spunter\u00e0, proprio a causa di quest'ultima botta, una strana protuberanza a cui Haruko sar\u00e0 tanto interessata da insediarsi in casa di Naota facendosi assumere come domestica dal padre.\n\nNaota ha per\u00f2 ben altri problemi a cui pensare: oltre a dover nascondere il \"bernoccolo\", ormai eccessivamente grande, ai suoi compagni di classe, deve far fronte alle avances di Mamimi il cui ragazzo, fratello maggiore di Naota, \u00e8 partito per l'America in cerca di successo. Sar\u00e0 proprio quel bernoccolo a complicargli la vita: in seguito a delle radiografie effettuate da Haruko si scopre che il cervello di Naota \u00e8 scomparso e, al suo posto, vi \u00e8 ora un varco dimensionale che lo collega alla Medical Meccanica, una fabbrica di \"robot per assistenza medica\" che sembrano avere in realt\u00e0 funzioni belliche.\n\nEpisodio dopo episodio dalla testa di Naota usciranno macchine sempre pi\u00f9 stravaganti, pi\u00f9 o meno antropomorfe, in grado di creare grande scompiglio nella tranquilla cittadina di Mabase, tutto ci\u00f2 grazie a una misteriosa capacit\u00e0 chiamata \"N.O.\"; grazie a questo potere, apparentemente innescato dalla differenza dei processi cerebrali tra emisfero destro e emisfero sinistro (anche se non viene mai spiegato chiaramente come), \u00e8 possibile richiamare oggetti di qualunque genere da ogni parte dell'universo grazie a un portale interdimensionale che si forma all'interno della testa del portatore. Peraltro, in alcuni contesti il N.O. sembra essere usato come una metafora della virilit\u00e0 dei protagonisti, specie quando Amarao si stupisce di come un bambino come Naota abbia un N.O. tanto pi\u00f9 potente di un adulto fatto e finito come lui, e la reazione di alcune assistenti di Amarao alla rivelazione dei poteri di Naota).\n\nIl bernoccolo di prima si riveler\u00e0 essere il dito di un androide con uno schermo al posto della testa, Canti, l'unico robot abbastanza docile da riuscire ad obbedire a Naota e alla sua famiglia che, infatti, lo impiegher\u00e0 nelle piccole commissioni e nei lavori domestici pi\u00f9 disparati. Sar\u00e0 Canti ad apparire come obiettivo degli altri robot che, uno dopo l'altro, cercheranno di contrastarlo con qualsiasi mezzo: egli rappresenta, infatti, una minaccia per la Medical Meccanica poich\u00e9, assorbendo Naota, \u00e8 in grado di ottenere una forza straordinaria. Ma anche Haruko \u00e8 interessata a questo enorme potere: armata del suo micidiale basso Rickenbacker cercher\u00e0 di proteggere il prezioso Canti, e non ha intenzione di smettere di combattere fino a che non si sar\u00e0 riappropriata di ci\u00f2 che la M.M. le ha rubato, Atomsk, il mitico Re dei Pirati, un essere il cui N.O \u00e8 tanto grande da permettergli di rubare interi pianeti."
