Could it possibly be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects\u2026 Harry Potter himself!",

        "brief": "Attachment theory has entered the mainstream, but most discussions focus on how we can cultivate secure monogamous relationships. What if, like many people, you're striving for secure, happy attachments with more than one partner?\n \n Polyamorous psychotherapist Jessica Fern breaks new ground by extending attachment theory into the realm of consensual nonmonogamy. Using her nested model of attachment and trauma, she expands our understanding of how these emotional experiences influence our relationships. Then, she sets out six specific strategies to help you move toward secure attachments in your multiple relationships.\n \n  Polysecure  is both a trailblaizing theoretical treatise and a practical guide. It provides nonmonogamous people with a new set of tools to navigate the complexities of multiple loving relationships, and offers radical new concepts that are sure to influence the conversation about attachment theory.",

        "brief": "Este livro recupera e retoma o debate sobre mesti\u00e7agem, mistura e morenidade no Brasil sem cair nas tradicionais armadilhas de festej\u00e1-las como evid\u00eancias de rela\u00e7\u00f5es raciais harm\u00f4nicas, denunci\u00e1-las como falta de consci\u00eancia racial ou essencializ\u00e1-las como causa da nossa desigualdade. Este livro leva a s\u00e9rio a categoria \u201cpardo\u201d historicamente negligenciada pelas Ci\u00eancias Sociais. Pardos que est\u00e3o t\u00e3o pr\u00f3ximos dos que se identificam como pretos nos indicadores socioecon\u00f4micos, mas t\u00e3o distantes na percep\u00e7\u00e3o sobre a discrimina\u00e7\u00e3o \u2014 um paradoxo que estimula o trabalho e inspirou o t\u00edtulo. A obra analisa teoricamente as tens\u00f5es e ambiguidades da constru\u00e7\u00e3o da mesti\u00e7agem, sua interseccionalidade com as quest\u00f5es de classe e g\u00eanero e suas transforma\u00e7\u00f5es ao longo do tempo. Sem d\u00favida, trata-se de uma refer\u00eancia inspiradora e inovadora para os que querem conhecer mais sobre as continuidades e mudan\u00e7as da forma\u00e7\u00e3o racial brasileira.",

In an age of ferment, following the American and French revolutions, Mary Wollstonecraft took prevailing egalitarian principles and dared to apply them to women.

It is difficult now to appreciate how audacious an undertaking the epic represents, and how astonishing its immediate and continued success was. Over the course of twelve books John Milton wrote an epic poem that would \"justify the ways of God to men,\" a mission that required a complex drama, the source of which is both historical and deeply personal. While the struggle for ascendancy between God and Satan is played out across hell, heaven, and earth in the work, the consequences of the Fall are all too humanly tragic, with pride, ambition, and aspiration being the motivating forces. \n\nIn this new edition derived from their acclaimed Oxford Authors text, Stephen Orgel and Jonathan Goldberg discuss the complexity of Milton's Paradise Lost in a new introduction. They contextualize Milton and his poem, discuss its structure and language, and provide a summary of critical responses to the poem since its initial publication. They also include on-page notes to explain the poem's language and allusions. This modernized edition of one of the most influential works in the English language will truly bring to light Milton's genius for today's reader.",

Google annihilates your privacy and Facebook amplifies right-wing propaganda because it is profitable to do so. But the internet wasn't always like this\u2014it had to be remade for the purposes of profit maximization, through a years-long process of privatization that turned a small research network into a powerhouse of global capitalism. Tarnoff tells the story of the privatization that made the modern internet, and which set in motion the crises that consume it today.\n \n The solution to those crises is straightforward: deprivatize the internet. Deprivatization aims at creating an internet where people, and not profit, rule. It calls for shrinking the space of the market and diminishing the power of the profit motive. It calls for abolishing the walled gardens of Google, Facebook, and the other giants that dominate our digital lives and developing publicly and cooperatively owned alternatives that encode real democratic control. To build a better internet, we need to change how it is owned and organized. Not with an eye towards making markets work better, but towards making them less dominant. Not in order to create a more competitive or more rule-bound version of privatization, but to overturn it. Otherwise, a small number of executives and investors will continue to make choices on everyone\u2019s behalf, and these choices will remain tightly bound by the demands of the market.

We want to annihilate bourgeois morality and make ruins of this world. We're here to destroy what is destroying us.\n\n Let's be speaking of revolt. We are tracing the lineage of our queer criminality and charting the demise of the social order. And oh the nectar from which we drink: lesbian pirates raging the seas, queer rioters setting cop cars ablaze, sex parties amidst the decay of industrialism, bank robbers wearing pink triangles, mutual aid networks among sex workers and thieves, gangs of trannyfags bashing-the-fuck-back. We've been assured that each day could be our last. As such we've chosen to live as if every day is. In turn, we promise that the existent's days are numbered.\"",

According to The Final Hours of Portal 2, the year is established to be \"somewhere in 2010\"\u2014twelve years after Aperture Science has been abandoned.\n\nThe game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence, about upcoming tests. Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person.[4] Chell is promised cake as her reward if she completes all test chambers.[19]\n\nChell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister; although she is designed to appear encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, tests including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the test. However, GLaDOS declares it must be euthanized in an \"emergency intelligence incinerator\" before Chell can continue.[17] Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled.[20][21]\n\nAfter Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center.[22] GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the \"party escort submission position\", lying face-first on the ground, so that a \"party associate\" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues her escape. In this section, GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center.[11][12] Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem \"The Chariot\", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and Emily Bront\u00eb's \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.[4]\n\nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas. With it removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally, with taunts and juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. Following the announcement of Portal 2, the ending was expanded in a later update. In this retroactive continuity, Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the \"party escort submission position\".[15][23]\n\nThe final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a Black Forest cake,[24] and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. The cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, causing the room to blackout.[25] As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song \"Still Alive\", which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive,[26] that her \"happy\" core was not disabled."

The episode is a stand-alone game; while a continuation of Half-Life 2, it does not require the original game to be installed or registered to a user's Steam account to play. It takes advantage of several major upgrades to the Source engine since the release of Half-Life 2, primarily its high dynamic range rendering capabilities and the upgraded facial animation system.\n\nEpisode One was released together with Half-Life Deathmatch: Source, a port of the original Half-Life's multiplayer, which doubles as Episode One's multiplayer component. The retail copies of Episode One also come with Half-Life 2 Deathmatch for those who have not previously purchased the later title.\n\nTaking place in City 17, just after the events of the last game, Half-Life 2: Episode one again follows scientist Gordon Freeman and his friend Alyx Vance as they stabilize a damaged Citadel core to buy time before it explodes, which will destroy the city and the surrounding area. They then rush to make it out of a war-torn City 17 as quickly as possible and also help evacuate any remaining citizens left."

Reborn into a corrupt era, the Tenno are sought by the oppressive Grineer Empire for annihilation. Warframe armor is the key to overthrowing the Grineer by providing players with unique offensive and defensive powers to explore, upgrade and master during purpose-driven radical raids.\n\nThey were called Tenno. Warriors of blade and gun: masters of the Warframe armor. Those that survived the old war were left drifting among the ruins. Now they are needed once more.\n\nThe Grineer, with their vast armies, are spreading throughout the solar system. A call echoes across the stars summoning the Tenno to an ancient place. They summon you.\n\nAllow the Lotus to guide you. She has rescued you from your cryostasis chamber and given you a chance to survive. The Grineer will find you; you must be prepared. The Lotus will teach you the ways of the Warframes and the secrets to unlocking their powers.\n\nCome Tenno, you must join the war."

Take on the role of a hunter and slay ferocious monsters in a living, breathing ecosystem where you can use the landscape and its diverse inhabitants to get the upper hand. Hunt alone or in co-op with up to three other players, and use materials collected from fallen foes to craft new gear and take on even bigger, badder beasts!  INTRODUCTION   Overview \n  Battle gigantic monsters in epic locales. \n \n As a hunter, you'll take on quests to hunt monsters in a variety of habitats.\n Take down these monsters and receive materials that you can use to create stronger weapons and armor in order to hunt even more dangerous monsters.\n \n In Monster Hunter: World, the latest installment in the series, you can enjoy the ultimate hunting experience, using everything at your disposal to hunt monsters in a new world teeming with surprises and excitement.\n  \n \n  Setting \n Once every decade, elder dragons trek across the sea to travel to the land known as the New World in a migration referred to as the Elder Crossing.\n \n To get to the bottom of this mysterious phenomenon, the Guild has formed the Research Commission, dispatching them in large fleets to the New World.\n \n As the Commission sends its Fifth Fleet in pursuit of the colossal elder dragon, Zorah Magdaros, one hunter is about to embark on a journey grander than anything they could have ever imagined.\n    ECOSYSTEM   A World That Breathes Life \n There are various locations teeming with wildlife. Expeditions into these locales are bound to turn up interesting discoveries.  HUNTING   A Diverse Arsenal, and an Indispensable Partner \n Your equipment will give you the power to need to carve out a place for yourself in the New World.\n \n  The Hunter's Arsenal \n There are fourteen different weapons at the hunter's disposal, each with its own unique characteristics and attacks. Many hunters acquire proficiency in multiple types, while others prefer to attain mastery of one.\n  \n \n  Scoutflies \n Monster tracks, such as footprints and gashes, dot each locale. Your Scoutflies will remember the scent of a monster and guide you to other nearby tracks. And as you gather more tracks, the Scoutflies will give you even more information.\n  \n \n  Slinger \n The Slinger is an indispensable tool for a hunter, allowing you to arm yourself with stones and nuts that can be gathered from each locale.\n From diversion tactics to creating shortcuts, the Slinger has a variety of uses, and allows you to hunt in new and interesting ways.\n  \n \n  Specialized Tools \n Specialized tools activate powerful effects for a limited amount of time, and up to two can be equipped at a time. Simple to use, they can be selected and activated just like any other item you take out on a hunt.\n  \n \n  Palicoes \n Palicoes are hunters' reliable comrades out in the field, specialized in a variety of offensive, defensive, and restorative support abilities.\n The hunter's Palico joins the Fifth Fleet with pride, as much a bona fide member of the Commission as any other hunter.\n  "

NEW BADDIES A Bro only becomes a force when confronted with those who seek to destroy their freedoms, and in Broforce Forever, the terrorists are even more determined to delete democracy. Motorbike Maniacs will try to run you down, while machine gun placements, barbed wire, sandbags and bazooka-laden blimps conspire to make each visit to occupied territory a very, very bad day at the broffice. NEW CHALLENGES Bros in search of even bigger battles can flex their muscles in new challenge levels known as Muscle Temples. Each campaign tasks Indiana Brones with navigating a perilous temple that features a new Threat Level and specific enemy types and hazards. Succeed and unlock one of four new flexes that can be deployed by any Bro, any time, any place. Just like freedom.\n \n  About the Game When evil threatens the world, the world calls on Broforce - an under-funded, over-powered paramilitary organization dealing exclusively in excessive force.

Bro-Op \u0026 Deathmatch Battle terrorism with up to four players in cooperative mode or sever ties with your bros and face each other in several bombastic competitive modes.

NEUE BROS Nutze die berechnende Intelligenz und das S\u00e4urespeien von Seth Brondle, f\u00fchre Xebros fliegendes Chakram, bring dem Terrorismus mit dem Mariachi-Hitzkopf Desperabro ein (explosives) St\u00e4ndchen oder werde zum Albtraum aller Monster: eine Pfl\u00f6cke schleudernde, D\u00e4monen bek\u00e4mpfende, sich selbst wiederbelebende, jugendliche J\u00e4gerin!\n \n Wenn pr\u00e4zise Sch\u00fcsse eher dein Stil sind, kann der ber\u00fchmte Insektenj\u00e4ger Burt Brommer mit seinem zuverl\u00e4ssigen Gewehr punktgenaue Befreiung bringen, w\u00e4hrend Demolition Bros Freeze Grenades (Frostgranaten) B\u00f6sewichte AUF EIS legen, wie es sich geh\u00f6rt. NEUE SCHURKEN Ein Bro ist erst dann in seinem Element, wenn er gegen die antritt, die seine Freiheit vernichten wollen, und in Broforce Forever arbeiten die Terroristen noch entschlossener an der Ausl\u00f6schung der Demokratie. Motorbike Maniacs (Motorradfanatiker) versuchen dich zu \u00fcberfahren und machen jeden Besuch in besetztem Gebiet zusammen mit MG-Nestern, Stacheldraht, Sands\u00e4cken und Luftschiffen voller Panzerf\u00e4uste zu einem sehr, sehr harten Weg, dir deine Bro-tchen zu verdienen. NEUE HERAUSFORDERUNGEN Bros, die noch gr\u00f6\u00dfere Schlachten suchen, k\u00f6nnen sich in neuen Herausforderungsleveln beweisen: den Muscle Temples (Muskeltempeln). In jeder Kampagne muss Indiana Brones einen gef\u00e4hrlichen Tempel durchqueren, der ein neues Bedrohungsmeter sowie bestimmte Gegnertypen und Risiken bietet. Schaffe das, und du schaltest eines von vier neuen Muskelspielen frei, das jeder Bro dann jederzeit und \u00fcberall einsetzen kann. Genau wie die Freiheit.\n \n  Infos zum Spiel Wenn wieder einmal das B\u00f6se die Welt bedroht, muss die Broforce die Kastanien aus dem Feuer holen \u2013 eine unterfinanzierte, \u00fcberm\u00e4chtige paramilit\u00e4rische Organisation, spezialisiert auf exzessive Gewaltanwendung. Ziehe mit bis zu drei Kumpels in die Schlacht und eliminiere in der Rolle dutzender \u201eBros\u201c die Terroristen, die unsere Lebensweise bedrohen. Setze eine Vielzahl einzigartiger Waffen ein und l\u00f6se im Namen des Friedens unglaubliche Kettenreaktionen aus Feuer, Napalm und abgetrennten Gliedma\u00dfen aus. Die Broforce Setze deine eigene Art von Schocktaktik ein und w\u00e4hle aus dutzenden von Bros, wobei jeder mit eigenen Waffen und Spezialangriffen ausgestattet ist, die zum Verbreiten der Freiheit in der Welt entwickelt wurden. Bro-Op \u0026 Deathmatch Bek\u00e4mpfe den Terrorismus in einem Koop-Team von bis zu vier Spielern oder wende dich gegen deine Bros und tritt in mehreren bombastischen Wettkampfmodi gegen sie an. Explosion Run (Explosionslauf) Tu dich mit anderen Bros zusammen und bew\u00e4ltige diese speziellen Level im Wettlauf gegen die Zeit, w\u00e4hrend das Gel\u00e4nde explodiert und alles im Chaos versinkt. Alles komplett zerst\u00f6rbar Das zerst\u00f6rbare Gel\u00e4nde er\u00f6ffnet eine F\u00fclle strategischer Optionen und dank der zahlreichen Exploding Red Barrels of Justice\u2122 (roten Explosivf\u00e4sser der Gerechtigkeit\u2122) kannst du das Spielfeld buchst\u00e4blich mit einem Schuss dem Erdboden gleichmachen. Level-Editor Gestalte mit dem robusten Level-Editor dein eigenes Spielfeld der Zerst\u00f6rung und sichere dir den Neid der anderen Bros, indem du deine Kreationen online teilst. Durchst\u00f6bere zahllose von Nutzern erstellte Level und schlie\u00dfe sie ab, um ihre Bro-ness zu bewerten."

Uma e outra vez. Para sempre. NOVOS BROS Tira partido da intelig\u00eancia calculista e do encanto cuspidor de \u00e1cido de Seth Brondle, empunha o Chakram voador da Xebro, faz uma serenata (explosiva) ao terrorismo com o mariachi Desperabro ou torna-te aquilo que os pr\u00f3prios monstros temem: uma Ca\u00e7adora adolescente que lan\u00e7a estacas, faz purgas profanas e consegue ressuscitar!\n \n Se o teu estilo \u00e9 mais o de atirador furtivo, o famoso ca\u00e7ador de insetos Burt Brommer conquista liberdade com a precis\u00e3o da sua fiel carabina, enquanto as granadas congelantes do Demolition Bro devolvem os malfeitores a onde pertencem\u2026 AO GELO. NOVOS VIL\u00d5ES Um Bro s\u00f3 usa a for\u00e7a quando \u00e9 confrontado pela destrui\u00e7\u00e3o da sua liberdade. E em Broforce Forever, os terroristas est\u00e3o ainda mais determinados a eliminar a democracia. Os Motorbike Maniacs v\u00e3o tentar atropelar-te e aplicar metralhadoras fixas, arame farpado, sacos de areia e dirig\u00edveis carregados de bazucas, para tornar um aut\u00eantico mart\u00edrio cada visita que fizeres ao territ\u00f3rio ocupado. NOVOS DESAFIOS Os Bros que procurem batalhas ainda mais imponentes podem mostrar os m\u00fasculos em novos n\u00edveis de desafio conhecidos como Muscle Temples (Templos dos M\u00fasculos). Em cada campanha, o Indiana Brones ter\u00e1 de explorar um templo perigoso com um novo n\u00edvel de amea\u00e7a, bem como inimigos de tipos e riscos espec\u00edficos. Triunfa e desbloqueia uma de quatro novas poses que podem ser aplicadas por qualquer Bro, em qualquer altura, em qualquer lugar. Tal como a liberdade.\n \n  Acerca do jogo Quando for\u00e7as mal\u00e9ficas amea\u00e7am o mundo, \u00e9 chamada a Broforce, uma organiza\u00e7\u00e3o paramilitar com poucos recursos, mas com poder de sobra e que s\u00f3 trabalha na base da for\u00e7a bruta. Cerra os dentes e prepara-te para tiroteios explosivos com at\u00e9 quatro jogadores e dezenas de Bros diferentes. Elimina as for\u00e7as terroristas que amea\u00e7am o nosso modo de vida! Usa carradas de armas \u00fanicas e detona rea\u00e7\u00f5es em cadeia de fogo, napalm e peda\u00e7os de inimigos\u2026 em nome da liberdade! A Broforce Causa choque e pavor \u00e0 tua maneira com dezenas de Bros, cada um com o seu armamento e ataques especiais. Distribui resmas de liberdade pelo mundo fora. Bro-Op e Deathmatch (Todos contra todos) Combate o terrorismo com at\u00e9 quatro jogadores no modo cooperativo ou corta la\u00e7os com os teus Bros e enfrentem-se em v\u00e1rios modos competitivos absolutamente bomb\u00e1sticos. Explosion Run (Fuga explosiva) Junta-te a outros Bros para enfrentar estes n\u00edveis contrarrel\u00f3gio \u00fanicos sob a press\u00e3o de terrenos que explodem e um caos descomunal. Destr\u00f3i tudo O terreno destrut\u00edvel permite todo um leque de op\u00e7\u00f5es estrat\u00e9gicas, ao passo que a abund\u00e2ncia de Exploding Red Barrels of Justice\u2122 (Barris Vermelhos Explosivos da Justi\u00e7a\u2122) pode literalmente nivelar o terreno com um \u00fanico tiro. Editor de n\u00edveis Desenha o teu recreio de destrui\u00e7\u00e3o com um robusto editor de n\u00edveis e faz inveja aos outros Bros ao partilh\u00e1-lo online. Tamb\u00e9m podes explorar os n\u00edveis criados por outros utilizadores e complet\u00e1-los para avaliar se s\u00e3o mesmo dignos de um Bro."

And again. Forever. NEW BROS Harness the calculating intelligence and acid-spitting allure of Seth Brondle, wield Xebro\u2019s flying Chakram, serenade (and grenade) terrorism with the flamenco firebrand Desperabro, or become the thing monsters have nightmares about, a stake throwing, unholy purging, self-resurrecting teenage Slayer!\n \n If sniping is more your style, famed bug hunter Bro Gummer brings pinpoint liberation with his trusty rifle, while Demolition Bro\u2019s Freeze Grenades put evildoers right back where they belong\u2026 ON ICE. NEW BADDIES A Bro only becomes a force when confronted with those who seek to destroy their freedoms, and in Broforce Forever, the terrorists are even more determined to delete democracy. Motorbike Maniacs will try to run you down, while machine gun placements, barbed wire, sandbags and bazooka-laden blimps conspire to make each visit to occupied territory a very, very bad day at the broffice. NEW CHALLENGES Bros in search of even bigger battles can flex their muscles in new challenge levels known as Muscle Temples. Each campaign tasks Indiana Brones with navigating a perilous temple that features a new Threat Level and specific enemy types and hazards. Succeed and unlock one of four new flexes that can be deployed by any Bro, any time, any place. Just like freedom.\n \n  About the Game When evil threatens the world, the world calls on Broforce - an under-funded, over-powered paramilitary organization dealing exclusively in excessive force. Brace your loins with up to four players to run \u2018n\u2019 gun as dozens of different bros and eliminate the opposing terrorist forces that threaten our way of life. Unleash scores of unique weapons and set off incredible chain reactions of fire, napalm, and limbs in the name of freedom.\n \n     The Broforce Deliver your own brand of shock and awe with dozens of bros each with their own unique weaponry and special attacks designed to dispatch freedom across the world. Bro-Op \u0026 Deathmatch Battle terrorism with up to four players in cooperative mode or sever ties with your bros and face each other in several bombastic competitive modes. Explosion Run Join up with other bros to tackle these unique time attack levels under the pressure of exploding terrains and mass chaos. Fully Destructible Everything Destructible terrain opens up a slew of strategic options while the abundance of Exploding Red Barrels of Justice\u2122 can literally level the playing field with one shot. Level Editor Design your own playground of destruction with a robust level editor and become the envy of all the other bros by sharing them online. Browse through scores of custom user created levels and complete them to rate their Bro-ness."

NUOVI BRO Sfrutta l'intelligenza calcolatrice e il fascino sputa-acido di Seth Brondle, brandisci il Chakram volante di Xebro, fai una serenata (e lancia una granata) al terrorismo con il mariachi testa calda Desperabro o diventa l'incubo dei mostri: una cacciatrice adolescente che lancia paletti, epura la malvagit\u00e0 e si rianima da sola!\n \n Se il cecchinaggio fa per te, il famoso cacciatore Burt Brommer porter\u00e0 la libert\u00e0 con il suo fucile, mentre le Freeze Grenades (Granate congelanti) di Demolition Bro faranno restare i nemici... DI GHIACCIO. NUOVI NEMICI Un Bro diventa forte quando si confronta con chi vuole minare le sue libert\u00e0, e in Broforce Forever i terroristi sono ancora pi\u00f9 determinati a eliminare la democrazia. I Motorbike Maniacs (Motomaniaci) cercheranno di investirti, e mitragliatrici, filo spinato, sacchi di sabbia e dirigibili carichi di bazooka renderanno ogni visita al territorio occupato un'impresa ardua che metter\u00e0 a dura prova la pazienza dei Bro. NUOVE SFIDE I Bro in cerca di battaglie ancora maggiori possono mostrare i muscoli nei nuovi livelli di sfida conosciuti come Muscle Temples (Templi muscolari). Ogni campagna richiede che Indiana Brones attraversi un tempio pericoloso che presenta un nuovo livello minaccia e tipi di nemici e pericoli specifici. Supera l'impresa e sblocca una delle quattro nuove pose per mostrare i muscoli utilizzabili da qualsiasi Bro, quando e dove vuoi. Come la libert\u00e0.\n \n  Informazioni sul gioco Quando il male minaccia il mondo, il mondo chiama in aiuto Broforce, un'organizzazione paramilitare potente ma sottofinanziata che agisce con violenza eccessiva. Insieme a un massimo di quattro giocatori, corri e spara nei panni di Bro diversi ed elimina le forze terroriste nemiche che minacciano la nostra vita. Manda a segno attacchi con armi uniche e innesca reazioni a catena a suon di spari, napalm e violenza in nome della libert\u00e0. Broforce Sfodera il tuo stile di colpi e sbalordisci tutti con decine di Bro, ognuno con armi e attacchi speciali personali ideati per riportare la libert\u00e0 nel mondo. Bro-Op e Deathmatch (Modalit\u00e0 Brooperativa e Deathmatch) Combatti il terrorismo insieme a un massimo di quattro giocatori in modalit\u00e0 cooperativa o separati dai tuoi Bro affrontandoli in tante eccezionali modalit\u00e0 competitive. Explosion Run (Corsa esplosiva) Unisciti ai Bro e affronta livelli a tempo unici su terreni esplosivi e caos assoluto. Fully Destructible Everything (Distruttibilit\u00e0 totale) L'ambiente distruttibile offre infinite opzioni strategiche, e usando Exploding Red Barrels of Justice\u2122 (Barili esplosivi rossi della Giustizia\u2122) \u00e8 possibile radere al suolo ogni cosa in un solo colpo. Editor livelli Crea la tua area personale di distruzione con un fantastico editor livelli e suscita l'invidia di tutti gli altri Bro tramite la condivisione online. Sfoglia decine di livelli personalizzati creati dagli utenti e completali per valutare il loro cameratismo."

        "brief": "BioShock Infinite is the third game in the BioShock series. It is not a direct sequel/prequel to any of the previous BioShock games but takes place in an entirely different setting, although it shares similar features, gameplay and concepts with the previous games. BioShock Infinite features a range of environments that force the player to adapt, with different weapons and strategies for each situation. Interior spaces feature close combat with enemies, but unlike previous games set in Rapture, the setting of Infinite contains open spaces with emphasis on sniping and ranged combat against as many as fifteen enemies at once.\n\nBioShock Infinite takes place in the airborne city of Columbia in 1912, where the player assumes the role of Booker DeWitt, a disgraced ex-Pinkerton agent. Booker has been given the job of finding a mysterious and powerful woman imprisoned in Columbia since birth named Elizabeth in order to wipe his debts away, and the story follows the unlikely duo as they journey to escape the flying city while discovering its twisted secrets.",

The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.\n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive.\n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.",

        "description": "Fallout 3 from the creators of the award-winning Oblivion, featuring one of the most realized game worlds ever created. Create any kind of character you want and explore the open wastes of post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. Every minute is a fight for survival as you encounter Super Mutants, Ghouls, Raiders and other dangers of the Wasteland. Prepare for the future.\n\nThe third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time.\n\nThe introductory sequence introduces the player to their character's father James, a doctor and scientist in Vault 101. James frequently makes comments about the player character's deceased mother Catherine, and her favorite Bible passage, Revelation 21:6, which speaks of \"the waters of life\".\n\nThe main quest begins after the player is forced to flee Vault 101 when James leaves the vault, throwing it into anarchy and causing the paranoid Overseer to send his security force after the player. The search for James takes the character on a journey through the Wasteland, first to the nearby town of Megaton, named for the undetonated atomic bomb at the center of town, then the Galaxy News Radio station, whose enthusiastic DJ Three Dog gives the player the moniker of \"The Lone Wanderer\". The player travels to Rivet City, a derelict aircraft carrier now serving as a fortified human settlement. Here the player meets Doctor Li, a scientist who worked alongside the player's father. Doctor Li informs the player of Project Purity, a plan conceived by Catherine and James to purify all the water in the Tidal Basin and eventually the entire Potomac River with a giant water purifier built in the Jefferson Memorial. However, continued delays and Catherine's death during childbirth put an end to the project, and James took the player's character as a newborn to raise them in the safety of Vault 101.\n\nAfter investigating the Jefferson Memorial, the Lone Wanderer tracks James to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Braun. James and the player return to Rivet City, and James reveals he sought out Braun for information on the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), a device that contains the components needed to finally activate Project Purity. James and Doctor Li lead a team of Rivet City scientists to the memorial with intent to restart the project, but the memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from the remnants of the pre-War United States government. James floods the project's control room with radiation to stop the Enclave military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it, killing himself (but Autumn survives), his last words urging his child to run. The Lone Wanderer and Dr. Li flee to the ruins of the Pentagon, now a base for the Brotherhood of Steel and now known as the Citadel.\n\nWith Project Purity still inoperable even with the Enclave occupying the site, the player travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K. and finish James's work. The player finds the Vault to be a testing site for the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), and the source of the Super Mutants in the Capital Wasteland. After the player acquires the G.E.C.K., the Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave and captured.\n\nAt the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the player is freed from their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry Eden, who requests a private audience with them. En route to his office however, Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders and takes command of the Enclave military, ordering them to kill the player. Fighting their way to Eden's office, the player discovers Eden is actually a sentient ZAX series supercomputer who took control of the Enclave after their defeat in Fallout 2 on the West Coast thirty years ago. Eden wishes to repeat the plan of then-President Dick Richardson using Project Purity, infecting the water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life. This plan will kill most life in the wasteland including humans, but the Enclave, due to their genetic \"purity\" as a result of their isolation, will be immune and free to take control of the area. The Wanderer, provided with a sample of the new F.E.V., is given a choice to either leave peacefully or convince Eden to self-destruct the entire base. The Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock and returns to the Citadel.\n\nWith the knowledge they possess, the G.E.C.K. and the means to activate Project Purity, the Brotherhood assault the Jefferson Memorial, spearheaded by a giant robot named Liberty Prime. In the control room of Project Purity the player confronts Colonel Autumn, and has the choice to persuade him to give up or kill him. Dr. Li informs the player that the purifier is ready to be activated, but the activation code must be input manually, and also that the control room is flooded with lethal amounts of radiation. The Lone Wanderer is forced to choose between sending Sarah Lyons of the Brotherhood inside the extremely irradiated purifier or entering themselves. Whoever enters into the chamber inputs the code hinted at through the game, that being 21:6, and dies from a radiation spike.",

        "brief": "Fallout 3 from the creators of the award-winning Oblivion, featuring one of the most realized game worlds ever created. Create any kind of character you want and explore the open wastes of post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. Every minute is a fight for survival as you encounter Super Mutants, Ghouls, Raiders and other dangers of the Wasteland. Prepare for the future.\n\nThe third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time.\n\nThe introductory sequence introduces the player to their character's father James, a doctor and scientist in Vault 101. James frequently makes comments about the player character's deceased mother Catherine, and her favorite Bible passage, Revelation 21:6, which speaks of \"the waters of life\".\n\nThe main quest begins after the player is forced to flee Vault 101 when James leaves the vault, throwing it into anarchy and causing the paranoid Overseer to send his security force after the player. The search for James takes the character on a journey through the Wasteland, first to the nearby town of Megaton, named for the undetonated atomic bomb at the center of town, then the Galaxy News Radio station, whose enthusiastic DJ Three Dog gives the player the moniker of \"The Lone Wanderer\". The player travels to Rivet City, a derelict aircraft carrier now serving as a fortified human settlement. Here the player meets Doctor Li, a scientist who worked alongside the player's father. Doctor Li informs the player of Project Purity, a plan conceived by Catherine and James to purify all the water in the Tidal Basin and eventually the entire Potomac River with a giant water purifier built in the Jefferson Memorial. However, continued delays and Catherine's death during childbirth put an end to the project, and James took the player's character as a newborn to raise them in the safety of Vault 101.\n\nAfter investigating the Jefferson Memorial, the Lone Wanderer tracks James to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Braun. James and the player return to Rivet City, and James reveals he sought out Braun for information on the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), a device that contains the components needed to finally activate Project Purity. James and Doctor Li lead a team of Rivet City scientists to the memorial with intent to restart the project, but the memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from the remnants of the pre-War United States government. James floods the project's control room with radiation to stop the Enclave military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it, killing himself (but Autumn survives), his last words urging his child to run. The Lone Wanderer and Dr. Li flee to the ruins of the Pentagon, now a base for the Brotherhood of Steel and now known as the Citadel.\n\nWith Project Purity still inoperable even with the Enclave occupying the site, the player travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K. and finish James's work. The player finds the Vault to be a testing site for the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), and the source of the Super Mutants in the Capital Wasteland. After the player acquires the G.E.C.K., the Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave and captured.\n\nAt the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the player is freed from their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry Eden, who requests a private audience with them. En route to his office however, Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders and takes command of the Enclave military, ordering them to kill the player. Fighting their way to Eden's office, the player discovers Eden is actually a sentient ZAX series supercomputer who took control of the Enclave after their defeat in Fallout 2 on the West Coast thirty years ago. Eden wishes to repeat the plan of then-President Dick Richardson using Project Purity, infecting the water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life. This plan will kill most life in the wasteland including humans, but the Enclave, due to their genetic \"purity\" as a result of their isolation, will be immune and free to take control of the area. The Wanderer, provided with a sample of the new F.E.V., is given a choice to either leave peacefully or convince Eden to self-destruct the entire base. The Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock and returns to the Citadel.\n\nWith the knowledge they possess, the G.E.C.K. and the means to activate Project Purity, the Brotherhood assault the Jefferson Memorial, spearheaded by a giant robot named Liberty Prime. In the control room of Project Purity the player confronts Colonel Autumn, and has the choice to persuade him to give up or kill him. Dr. Li informs the player that the purifier is ready to be activated, but the activation code must be input manually, and also that the control room is flooded with lethal amounts of radiation. The Lone Wanderer is forced to choose between sending Sarah Lyons of the Brotherhood inside the extremely irradiated purifier or entering themselves. Whoever enters into the chamber inputs the code hinted at through the game, that being 21:6, and dies from a radiation spike.",

The player's character begins on a sand dune in a seemingly endless desert. In the far distance looms a large, foreboding mountain with a glowing crevice that splits its peak. As the character approaches the mountain, they find remnants of a once-thriving civilization, eroded by sand over time. Scattered throughout the ruins at the end of each area are stones at which the traveler rests; these give the traveler the vision of meeting a larger, white-robed figure in a circular room, with art on the walls describing the rise and fall of the civilization, mirroring the player's journey.\n\nThe player continues to journey deeper into the remains of a once sprawling city at the base of the mountain. Eventually making it safely to the mountain, the traveler begins to climb it, struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds. With the crevice still a fair distance away, the traveler falls and collapses in the snow. Six of the white-robed figures appear and grant the traveler new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into and through the crevice as the screen fills with white. The player is then shown the game's credits, playing over the ending cinematic. This cinematic shows a shooting star emanating from the crevice and traversing the path the traveler took through the ruins, and shows glimpses of other robed travelers heading towards the mountain. Eventually, the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began, and the player is given the option of starting the game again.

        "description": "As Lara Croft races to save the world from a Maya apocalypse, she must become the Tomb Raider she is destined to be.\n\nIn the two months since Rise of the Tomb Raider, Lara Croft and her friend Jonah Maiava have dedicated themselves to stopping the activities of paramilitary organization Trinity. The two track a cell to Cozumel in Mexico that is led by Pedro Dominguez, the head of Trinity's High Council. Slipping inside nearby tombs being excavated by Trinity, Lara discovers a temple containing the Dagger of Chak Chel and references to a hidden city. Murals adorning the walls allude to the Silver Box of Ix Chel and warn of \"the Cleansing\", a Mayan apocalypse culminating in a permanent solar eclipse. Lara ignores the warnings and takes the Dagger to prevent Trinity from acquiring it. Dominguez catches her and reveals that by taking the Dagger, Lara has triggered the Cleansing. He takes the Dagger, intending to unite it with the Box to stop the Cleansing and use the power it grants him to remake the world in his image. Lara and Jonah escape a tsunami that destroys Cozumel and foreshadows the coming apocalypse.\nDespite growing tensions between them over her actions, Lara and Jonah pursue Dominguez into the Amazon. Their plane crashes in the Peruvian jungle during the second cataclysm\u2014a massive storm\u2014and the two find their way to Paititi, the hidden city shown in the murals. Exploring local tombs reveals that piercing the Box with the Dagger will grant the user the power of the god Kukulkan, which must be used to halt the Cleansing. Lara witnesses Trinity soldiers being slaughtered by strange humanoid monsters later identified as the Yaaxil, guardians of the Box. When Lara saves a boy named Etzli, she and Jonah are brought into Paititi by his mother Unuratu, queen of the city. Lara sees Dominguez is the leader of a cult dedicated to Kukulkan and Unuratu reveals he is her brother-in-law Amaru, who was taken by Trinity as a child and raised to complete the ritual and reshape the world in their image. Unuratu directs Lara to the Box, but Lara finds it is missing. Believing the cult already has the Box, Lara, and Unuratu attempt to steal it, but Unuratu is captured. Lara also encounters the Yaaxil and their leader Crimson Fire.\nLara infiltrates the cult's temple and overhears Amaru telling Unuratu that the Box was hidden by Andres Lopez, a missionary sent to Paititi by Trinity during the Spanish conquest of South America. Lara rescues Unuratu and realizes that Amaru does not fully understand the ritual; rather than merely imbuing Kukulkan's power, the ritual sacrifices it to stop the Cleansing. Unuratu is shot by Commander Rourke, Amaru's second in command. Before she dies, Unuratu implores Lara to complete the ritual but warns her not to let the Box influence her. Rourke attacks Lara and Jonah, who are separated as they leave Paititi to decipher the next clue. Thinking Jonah dead, Lara goes on a rampage that destroys an oil refinery and slaughters everyone there except Rourke, who escapes. She momentarily breaks down when she finds Jonah alive, but he manages to calm her, and they decipher the Box's location. Driven mad by the Box, Lopez established a mission near Paititi where he trained acolytes to complete the ritual. Lara and Jonah find a secret catacomb beneath the missiong leading to Lopez's tomb and the Box. Amaru finds them and forces Lara to surrender the Box. He admits that he ordered her father's death to prevent him from finding Paititi and revealing it to the world. Lara tries to persuade Amaru to use the ritual to benefit the world.

While the Yaaxil kill Rourke and the Trinity High Council, Lara makes it to the temple summit.

        "description": " Two young friends, lost in a frightening world not made for children. \n  If they cannot find a way out of this Nowhere place, they\u2019ll be condemned to a fate    worse than death.  \n \n  \n \n You play as Low and Alone, best friends ever since they found each other in this lonely nightmare. They each possess their own iconic item: a bow for Low and a wrench for Alone. Working together, they\u2019ve become adept at sneaking through hidden passages, hoisting each other over massive obstacles, and watching each other\u2019s backs. Whether you\u2019re playing with a friend or an A.I. companion, you\u2019ll depend on each other's iconic items to create opportunities and to progress. The environment is full of clues and possibilities for imaginative children to exploit. Low\u2019s arrows can reach high targets, cut through ropes, or down flying enemies, and Alone\u2019s wrench is just the thing for crushing stunned enemies, smashing through barriers, or manipulating the workings of massive machines.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n No matter where you go, the Nowhere is home to horrific monsters. These Residents won't hesitate to go out of their way to capture any intrusive little Visitors that draw their attention. You might find yourself playing a terrifying game of hide and seek with Monster Baby in the sandy ruins of the Necropolis, struggling to avoid swarms of voracious Candy Weevils in an unsetlling Candy Factory, or dodging heavy feet while running along the rain-soaked promenade of a filthy funfair. You'll need to be ready to run, hide, or even defend yourself at a moment's notice to stay in one piece.\n \n  \n \n  \n \n Don\u2019t be too distracted by the desolate beauty of the Nowhere. There are dark mysteries waiting for you as Low and Alone follow their mirror path across the Spiral. As each new location will become more dangerous and disturbing than the last, traumatic flashes from the past will begin to emerge. Will Low and Alone finally escape from this unending nightmare?\n  Only you can help them, little ones... \n \n  ",

By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.\n\nGordon Freeman is brought out of stasis by the G-Man, who inserts him into a train arriving at City 17. After arriving at the station and eluding Combine forces, Gordon joins Lambda resistance members including Barney Calhoun, a former Black Mesa security guard now working undercover as a Combine CP officer, and Alyx Vance, the daughter of one of Gordon's former colleagues, Dr. Eli Vance. After a failed attempt to teleport Gordon to Black Mesa East from Dr. Kleiner's makeshift laboratory, Gordon, re-equipped with the HEV suit and a crowbar, is forced to embark on foot through the city's old canal system. After obtaining an airboat, he battles his way to Black Mesa East, several miles from the city.\n\nGordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets Dr. Judith Mossman. Alyx introduces Gordon to her large pet robot D0g and gives him a \"Gravity Gun\", a weapon which allows Gordon to pick up and move any large object with ease. Black Mesa East soon comes under Combine attack and Eli and Mossman are captured to be taken to a Combine prison, Nova Prospekt. Gordon and Alyx are forced to take separate paths to Nova Prospekt; Gordon takes a detour through the town of Ravenholm, receiving help from its last survivor, Father Grigori. After making his way through the town and a mine, Gordon makes his way to a Resistance outpost. Gordon is provided with a Dune Buggy, which he uses to travel along a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt. Along the way, Gordon encounters frequent Combine patrols, and helps one of the resistance leaders, Colonel Odessa Cubbage, to defend a Resistance base from a Combine gunship.\n\nAfter crossing an antlion-infested beach, Gordon enters Nova Prospekt, where he is reunited with Alyx. They manage to locate Eli, but also discover that Mossman is a Combine informant. Before they can stop her, she teleports herself and Eli back to City 17's Citadel. The Combine teleporter explodes as Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt.\n\nUpon reaching Kleiner's lab, a shaken Dr. Kleiner reveals to Gordon and Alyx that they were caught in a \"slow teleport\", during which a week had passed. In their absence, the Resistance, who heard about what had happened at Nova Prospekt, has mobilized against the Combine, turning City 17 into a battleground. During the fighting, Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel, and Gordon fights through the city with the aid of D0g and Barney to reach it. Inside the Citadel, he is caught in a Combine confiscation chamber that destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun, the energy enhancing its capabilities and allowing Gordon to escape and dispatch platoons of Combine soldiers.\n\nEventually, Gordon is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office, where he and Dr. Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx in captivity. Dr. Breen begins to explain his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine, contrary to what he had told Dr. Mossman. Angered, Mossman frees Gordon, Alyx, and Eli before Breen teleports them off-world. Dr. Breen tries to escape through a portal, but Gordon pursues him and destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen appears to be annihilated in the resulting explosion.\n\nJust before Gordon and Alyx are presumably met with a similar fate, time is frozen. The G-Man reappears, praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel. Making vague mention of \"offers for [Gordon's] services\", the G-Man places him back into stasis."

This first-person roller-coaster initiated a new era in the history of action games by combining engrossing gameplay, upgraded graphics, ingenious level design and a revolutionary story that may not be all that it seems, told not through cutscenes, but through the visual environment.\n\nDr. Gordon Freeman arrives late for work at 8:47 am in the Black Mesa Research Facility, using the advanced Black Mesa tram system that leads through the facility. He arrives at the Anomalous Materials Lab, his work place, and he is informed by the security officer that the scientists have a special experiment today, so he goes to the locker room and puts on the hazard suit. He goes to the lab's lower levels, and arrives at the Anti-Mass Chamber, where he is instructed that the specimen to be used that day is the rarest and also the most unstable specimen. He is tasked with pushing the specimen into the scanning beam of the Anti-Mass Spectrometer for analysis. However as soon as he pushes it, it explodes, and creates a sudden catastrophe called a \"resonance cascade\", opening a portal between Earth and a dimension called Xen. Freeman is apparently teleported to an alien planet and catches glimpses of various alien lifeforms, including a circle of Vortigaunts, shortly before blacking out."

The game contains an open world design and strongly emphasizes exploration due to the world's large size. The game was very well received by critics, with many citing it as a great example of innovation and improvement in Japanese role-playing video games. The game has spawned a sub-series of the larger \"Xeno\" series, including Xenoblade Chronicles X (Wii U) and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (Switch).",

Saranno le tue decisioni ad alterare il corso degli eventi e a governare la storia attraverso le complesse ramificazioni della trama.\n Affronterai dilemmi morali e stabilirai chi vive e chi muore. Con migliaia di scelte e decine di finali possibili, come influirai sul futuro di Detroit e il destino dell'umanit\u00e0?\n     PRENDI PARTE A UNA STORIA COINVOLGENTE Entra in un universo in cui dilemmi morali e decisioni difficili possono trasformare degli schiavi androidi in rivoluzionari destinati a cambiare il mondo. Scopri cosa significa essere umani da una prospettiva esterna e guarda il mondo attraverso gli occhi di una macchina. LE LORO VITE, LE TUE SCELTE  Fatti strada attraverso un'ambiziosa struttura narrativa ramificata, in cui le tue decisioni non determinano solo il fato dei tre protagonisti, ma di tutta la citt\u00e0 di Detroit. Il modo in cui controllerai Kara, Connor e Markus far\u00e0 la differenza tra la vita e la morte. E se uno di loro la pagher\u00e0 a caro prezzo, la storia andr\u00e0 comunque avanti... INFINITE POSSIBILIT\u00c0, INFINITI FINALI  Ogni scelta che fai, per quanto piccola, influenza l'esito della storia. Nessuna partita sar\u00e0 esattamente uguale a un'altra: gioca pi\u00f9 e pi\u00f9 volte per arrivare a conclusioni totalmente differenti. OTTIMIZZATO PER PC  Detroit: Become Human ha una straordinaria grafica con risoluzione in 4K, frame rate di 60 FPS e integrazione completa di mouse/tastiera e gamepad per immergersi totalmente nell'esperienza di Detroit: Become Human.\n       "

Roam surroundings high and low, defend against unforeseen threats and solve the mysteries of this unwelcoming place inhabited by curious droids and dangerous creatures. \n  \nSee the world through the eyes of a cat and interact with the environment in playful ways. Be stealthy, nimble, silly, and sometimes as annoying as possible with the strange inhabitants of this mysterious world. \n \nAlong the way, the cat befriends a small flying drone, known only as B-12. With the help of this newfound companion, the duo must find a way out. \n \nStray is developed by BlueTwelve Studio, a small team from the south of France mostly made up of cats and a handful of humans.",

La ragazza schizofrenica di \"Doppio Legame\"? L'illusione di se stessa? Oppure solo l'illusione di tutti?"

        "description": "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (often shortened to Ziggy Stardust) is the fifth studio album by the English musician David Bowie, released on 16 June 1972 in the United Kingdom through RCA Records. It was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and features Bowie's backing band the Spiders from Mars, composed of Mick Ronson (guitar), Trevor Bolder (bass) and Mick Woodmansey (drums). It was recorded from November 1971 to February 1972 at Trident Studios in London.\n\nDescribed as a loose concept album and rock opera, Ziggy Stardust focuses on Bowie's titular alter ego Ziggy Stardust, a fictional androgynous and bisexual rock star who is sent to Earth as a saviour before an impending apocalyptic disaster. In the story, Ziggy wins the hearts of fans but suffers a fall from grace after succumbing to his own ego. The character was inspired by numerous musicians, including Vince Taylor. Most of the album's concept was developed after the songs were recorded. The glam rock and proto-punk musical styles were influenced by Iggy Pop, The Velvet Underground and Marc Bolan. The lyrics explore the artificiality of rock music, political issues, drug use, sexuality and stardom. The album cover, photographed in monochrome and recoloured, was taken in London outside the home of furriers \"K. West\". ",

The album cover, photographed in monochrome and recoloured, was taken in London outside the home of furriers \"K. West\". ",

In solitude, it grows stronger.\r\nA disconsolate heaviness seeps into every crack. Everything lively and radiant is needless.\r\n\u00a0\r\nConfined in a prison of freedom, cravenly calling for help. A chill engulfs the shapeless cage. Sharp barbs breed helplessness.\r\nThroat strangled by a rope\u2026 Can\u2019t make a sound\u2026 Numb body\u2026 Gradually recovers its sense of pain\u2026\r\n\u00a0\r\nDespair takes root in life\u2019s film negative, mingling different colours, absorbing the world\u2019s weight.\r\nEmpty hands, unescapable crowds. Burning flames catalyse an aberrant loneliness.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe mist of dreams, the silent undulating waves.\r\nTrapped in a marsh, there is no escape.\r\n\u00a0\r\nUnable to touch meaning.\r\n\u00a0\r\nFlower\u2019s grave.\r\n\r\n-by yikii",

Continuing the style developed on her first album Debut (1993), Bj\u00f6rk conceived of Post as a bolder and more extroverted set of songs than its predecessor, featuring an eclectic mixture of electronic and dance styles such as techno, trip hop, IDM, and house, alongside that of ambient, jazz, industrial, and experimental music. Bj\u00f6rk produced Post herself with co-producers including Nellee Hooper, 808 State's Graham Massey, and former Massive Attack member Tricky. She wrote most of the songs after moving to London and intended the album to reflect her new life in the city. ",

        "description": " How did the richest people on the planet make their billions? From Selena Gomez to Jeff Bezos, and now we find out about five dead billionaires. Meet pioneers who helped build the United States of America: the world\u2019s first billionaire John D Rockefeller, motor magnate Henry Ford, the aviator and filmmaker Howard Hughes, Walmart founder Sam Walton, and Hetty Green - once dubbed \u201cThe Witch of Wall Street\u201d. These iconic billionaires may be long dead, but their fingerprints are all over modern industry - in business trusts, IPOs, and mass production. They did it all first, but how did they make their billions?\n \nGood Bad Billionaire is the podcast that analyses the minds, motives and money of some of the world's wealthiest individuals. Simon and Zing explore the lives of the super-rich and famous, tracking their wealth, philanthropy, business ethics and success. From iconic celebrities and secretive CEOs to sporting legends and titans of technology, Simon and Zing find out how they made their money, and then it\u2019s over to you to decide whether they\u2019re good, bad, or just another billionaire. \n \nEver wondered how Taylor Swift went from country singer to money-spinner? How Amazon boss Jeff Bezos came to launch one of the biggest corporations of the internet age? And how six-time NBA champion Michael Jordan made his fortune with Nike? Trawl through the archives to find out how Selena Gomez went from a child Disney star to a mega-magnate of makeup and how Martha Stewart, the \u201coriginal lifestyle influencer\u201d became one of the most successful women in business. We explore the life of British inventor James Dyson and learn about some of the big names behind Minecraft, Marvel, WWE and the ultimate reality TV show \u2013 Big Brother.\n \nJoin us on a global journey, discovering all we can about some of the richest people on the planet. In the United States, there are leaders who made their money in Silicon Valley, on Wall Street and in high street fashion. Hear about billionaires in Russia, China, New Zealand, India, Nigeria and the UK. Exploring the lives of Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch, El Chapo, Narayana Murthy and Kim Kardashian, this podcast paints a vivid picture of business, entrepreneurship, capitalism and how our world really works.\n \nDiscover how the likes of Jerry Seinfeld, Peter Jackson, Doris Fisher and George Soros came to join the billionaires' club. Learn how Tiger Woods went from a child golfing prodigy to the world\u2019s highest paid athlete, how a communist mime artist became the boss of fashion house Prada and how Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich came to buy an English football club. Find out how Mukesh Ambani became Asia\u2019s richest person, and how Patrice Motsepe became the first black billionaire in a post-apartheid South Africa. Plus, we examine some of the biggest names behind the technology shaping our world \u2013 the founders of TikTok, Google, ChatGPT, Alibaba and Bumble.\n \nBut it's not just how these billionaires made their money; it's what they did with it next. Ultimately, Simon and Zing will help you decide whether they\u2019re a force for good, bad, or somewhere in between. Join Simon Jack, the business editor for BBC News, and journalist and author Zing Tsjeng as this podcast unravels tales of fortune, power, economics, ambition and moral responsibility, ultimately inviting you to make up your own mind: are they good, bad, or just another billionaire?\n \nWe\u2019d love to hear your feedback.

This is the start of a conversation about what developers are building, how they're building it, and what consumers need to be asking for. \n\nGuests will include Jack Dorsey (former CEO \u0026 co-founder of Twitter); Kara Swisher (host of On with Kara Swisher, co-host of Pivot); Cory Doctorow (science fiction author \u0026 former editor of Boing Boing); and Taylor Lorenz (founder of User Mag, host of Power User).",

Dalla fronte del ragazzo spunter\u00e0, proprio a causa di quest'ultima botta, una strana protuberanza a cui Haruko sar\u00e0 tanto interessata da insediarsi in casa di Naota facendosi assumere come domestica dal padre.\n\nNaota ha per\u00f2 ben altri problemi a cui pensare: oltre a dover nascondere il \"bernoccolo\", ormai eccessivamente grande, ai suoi compagni di classe, deve far fronte alle avances di Mamimi il cui ragazzo, fratello maggiore di Naota, \u00e8 partito per l'America in cerca di successo. Sar\u00e0 proprio quel bernoccolo a complicargli la vita: in seguito a delle radiografie effettuate da Haruko si scopre che il cervello di Naota \u00e8 scomparso e, al suo posto, vi \u00e8 ora un varco dimensionale che lo collega alla Medical Meccanica, una fabbrica di \"robot per assistenza medica\" che sembrano avere in realt\u00e0 funzioni belliche.\n\nEpisodio dopo episodio dalla testa di Naota usciranno macchine sempre pi\u00f9 stravaganti, pi\u00f9 o meno antropomorfe, in grado di creare grande scompiglio nella tranquilla cittadina di Mabase, tutto ci\u00f2 grazie a una misteriosa capacit\u00e0 chiamata \"N.O.\"; grazie a questo potere, apparentemente innescato dalla differenza dei processi cerebrali tra emisfero destro e emisfero sinistro (anche se non viene mai spiegato chiaramente come), \u00e8 possibile richiamare oggetti di qualunque genere da ogni parte dell'universo grazie a un portale interdimensionale che si forma all'interno della testa del portatore. Peraltro, in alcuni contesti il N.O. sembra essere usato come una metafora della virilit\u00e0 dei protagonisti, specie quando Amarao si stupisce di come un bambino come Naota abbia un N.O. tanto pi\u00f9 potente di un adulto fatto e finito come lui, e la reazione di alcune assistenti di Amarao alla rivelazione dei poteri di Naota).\n\nIl bernoccolo di prima si riveler\u00e0 essere il dito di un androide con uno schermo al posto della testa, Canti, l'unico robot abbastanza docile da riuscire ad obbedire a Naota e alla sua famiglia che, infatti, lo impiegher\u00e0 nelle piccole commissioni e nei lavori domestici pi\u00f9 disparati. Sar\u00e0 Canti ad apparire come obiettivo degli altri robot che, uno dopo l'altro, cercheranno di contrastarlo con qualsiasi mezzo: egli rappresenta, infatti, una minaccia per la Medical Meccanica poich\u00e9, assorbendo Naota, \u00e8 in grado di ottenere una forza straordinaria. Ma anche Haruko \u00e8 interessata a questo enorme potere: armata del suo micidiale basso Rickenbacker cercher\u00e0 di proteggere il prezioso Canti, e non ha intenzione di smettere di combattere fino a che non si sar\u00e0 riappropriata di ci\u00f2 che la M.M. le ha rubato, Atomsk, il mitico Re dei Pirati, un essere il cui N.O \u00e8 tanto grande da permettergli di rubare interi pianeti."
