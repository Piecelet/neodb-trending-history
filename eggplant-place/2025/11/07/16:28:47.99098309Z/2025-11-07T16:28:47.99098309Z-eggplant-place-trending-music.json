It was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and features Bowie's backing band the Spiders from Mars, composed of Mick Ronson (guitar), Trevor Bolder (bass) and Mick Woodmansey (drums). It was recorded from November 1971 to February 1972 at Trident Studios in London.\n\nDescribed as a loose concept album and rock opera, Ziggy Stardust focuses on Bowie's titular alter ego Ziggy Stardust, a fictional androgynous and bisexual rock star who is sent to Earth as a saviour before an impending apocalyptic disaster. In the story, Ziggy wins the hearts of fans but suffers a fall from grace after succumbing to his own ego. The character was inspired by numerous musicians, including Vince Taylor. Most of the album's concept was developed after the songs were recorded. The glam rock and proto-punk musical styles were influenced by Iggy Pop, The Velvet Underground and Marc Bolan. The lyrics explore the artificiality of rock music, political issues, drug use, sexuality and stardom.

J\u2019ai \u00e9vacu\u00e9 cette fureur en moi \u00bb, explique Florence Welch \u00e0 Zane Lowe d\u2019Apple Music \u00e0 propos du sixi\u00e8me album de Florence + the Machine. \u00ab Et c\u2019est le genre d\u2019album qui, si je ne l\u2019avais pas fait maintenant, ne serait jamais sorti, car je pense que ce que j\u2019ai ressenti est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9 \u00e0 cet instant pr\u00e9cis, et c\u2019est sorti de moi. Cet album m'a en quelque sorte aider \u00e0 affronter ce que j\u2019avais v\u00e9cu. \u00bb \n\nPour Welch, tout a commenc\u00e9 pendant la tourn\u00e9e <i>Dance Fever</i> du groupe. \u00ab Il s\u2019av\u00e8re que j\u2019ai fait une fausse couche sur sc\u00e8ne apr\u00e8s une grossesse extra-ut\u00e9rine, ce qui \u00e9tait dangereux, et j\u2019ai d\u00fb \u00eatre hospitalis\u00e9e et subir une intervention chirurgicale d\u2019urgence car j\u2019avais l\u2019\u00e9quivalent d\u2019une canette de Coca de sang dans l\u2019abdomen \u00bb, explique-t-elle. <i>Everybody Scream</i> \u00e9voque l\u2019\u00e9tat \u00e9motionnel de Welch \u00e0 la suite de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 : il en ressort une exp\u00e9rience aussi troublante que cathartique pour la chanteuse et les auditeurs et auditrices. \u00ab J\u2019avais l\u2019impression de ne plus avoir aucun contr\u00f4le sur mon corps ; j\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 \u00e7a int\u00e9ressant \u00bb, dit-elle. \u00ab Je me suis alors pench\u00e9e sur les th\u00e8mes de la sorcellerie et du mysticisme. Partout o\u00f9 je regardais, notamment dans les r\u00e9cits de naissance, je tombais sur des histoires de sorcellerie, des l\u00e9gendes effrayantes et des mythes populaires. \u00bb \n\nWelch int\u00e8gre alors ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 son album : on l\u2019entend g\u00e9mir, chanter d\u2019une voix aigu\u00eb, \u00e0 pleins poumons \u2014 et, bien s\u00fbr, elle hurle. Accompagn\u00e9e des talentueux Mitski, Aaron Dessner et Mark Bowen, le guitariste des IDLES, elle v\u00e9hicule une telle force \u00e9motionnelle \u00e0 travers un opus au charme ensorcelant. Le titre \u00e9ponyme m\u00e9dite sur la c\u00e9l\u00e9brit\u00e9 et le fait de surmonter la douleur pour se produire sur sc\u00e8ne : \u00ab But look at me run myself ragged/Blood on the stage/ But how can I leave you when you\u2019re screaming my name? \u00bb [Mais regardez-moi m\u2019\u00e9puiser/Du sang sur la sc\u00e8ne/Mais comment puis-je vous quitter quand vous criez mon nom ?]. \u00c9voquant une rave d\u00e9brid\u00e9e en for\u00eat, \u00ab Witch Dance \u00bb semble nous jeter un sort avec son rythme effr\u00e9n\u00e9 et les incantations a\u00e9riennes de Welch. Et pour la chanteuse, \u00ab Perfume and Milk \u00bb l\u2019a aid\u00e9e \u00e0 soulager ses propres souffrances. \u00ab Il s\u2019agit de gu\u00e9rir, d\u2019avoir vu les saisons changer et d\u2019avoir vu d\u2019autres choses grandir puis retourner \u00e0 la terre. J\u2019\u00e9voque ici le sentiment d\u2019avoir fait partie de cette nature et de ce cycle \u00bb, explique-t-elle.\n\n<i>Everybody Scream</i> se termine par une note d\u2019espoir avec la chanson \u00e9mouvante \u00ab And Love \u00bb : \u00ab Peace is coming \u00bb [La paix est proche], r\u00e9p\u00e8te-t-elle dans cette ballade. \u00ab Que celle-ci soit celle qui se r\u00e9alise \u00bb, dit-elle. \u00ab Que celle-ci soit celle qui se r\u00e9alise dans le monde.

{"lang": "en", "text": "Florence and the Machine Announce New Album Everybody Scream\nFlorence and the Machine will release a new album, Everybody Scream, on October 31. The Halloween-bound LP follows 2022\u2019s Dance Fever and its expanded edition in 2023. Details remain thin on the ground, but the album is up for pre-sale in various formats\u2014including some with bonus tracks and an alternate cover\u2014on Florence\u2019s website.\nFlorence Welch has posted a series of cryptic album teasers in recent months, including pictures in the studio with Idles guitarist Mark Bowen and a whiteboard that included the phrase \u201cSwans vs. Adele.\u201d Last year, Florence and the Machine released a cover of Walter Kent and Nat Burton\u2019s standard \u201c(There\u2019ll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover\u201d for Jack Antonoff\u2019s soundtrack to TV show The New Look."}], "cover_image_url": "https://eggplant.place/m/item/spotify_album/2025/11/04/88a82fcc-526c-4990-a7f7-4f797e3b3a4d.jpg", "rating": null, "rating_count": 2, "rating_distribution": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "tags": [], "brief": "\u201cThere was basically an urgency to this record. It came out of me in this furious burst,\u201d Florence Welch tells Apple Music\u2019s Zane Lowe of Florence + the Machine\u2019s sixth full-length. \u201cAnd it\u2019s one of those records where if I hadn\u2019t have put it out now, it never would\u2019ve come out because I think how I felt about things is so specific to this moment in time, and this roared out of me. It was made almost like a coping mechanism.\u201d\n\nThat moment in time began for Welch during the <i>Dance Fever</i> tour. \u201cI actually ended up having a ectopic miscarriage onstage that was dangerous, and that I had to be hospitalized for, and I had to have immediate surgery because I had a Coke can of blood in my abdomen,\u201d she explains. Her health crisis and ensuing feelings fueled <i>Everybody Scream</i>, which offers a haunting yet cathartic experience for both the singer and those listening. \u201cI felt so out of control of my body, it was interesting,\u201d she says. \u201cI looked into themes of witchcraft, and mysticism, and everywhere that you looked in terms of birth or stories of birth, you came across stories of witchcraft, and folk horror, and myths.\u201d\n\nInfusing those elements throughout the album, Welch wails, warbles, belts\u2014and, yes, screams\u2014with emotional clarity and appropriately witchy charisma while getting quality assistance in the form of Mitski, Aaron Dessner, and IDLES guitarist Mark Bowen. The title track muses on fame and pushing through the pain to perform: \u201cBut look at me run myself ragged/Blood on the stage/But how can I leave you when you\u2019re screaming my name?\u201d Conjuring up a bacchanalian forest rave, \u201cWitch Dance\u201d casts a spell with its heated pace and Welch\u2019s breathy chants. And for the singer, \u201cPerfume and Milk\u201d helps alleviate her own agony. \u201cIt was about healing and having watched seasons change and having watched other things growing and then returning to the earth and a sense that I was also part of that nature and part of that cycle,\u201d she says.\n\n<i>Everybody Scream</i> ends with the stirring \u201cAnd Love,\u201d striking a hopeful note: \u201cPeace is coming\u201d she repeats on the ballad. \u201cLet this one be the one that comes true,\u201d she says. \u201cLet this one be the one that is realized in the world. I think the songs are always three steps ahead of me. It\u2019s been that way my whole life.\u201d", "id": "https://eggplant.place/album/7aK2EZJwTOaDjEubUo0Ibw", "uuid": "7aK2EZJwTOaDjEubUo0Ibw", "url": "/album/7aK2EZJwTOaDjEubUo0Ibw", "api_url":
