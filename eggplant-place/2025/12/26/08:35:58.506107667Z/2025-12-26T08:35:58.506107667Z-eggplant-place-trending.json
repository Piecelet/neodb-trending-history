How do we cultivate hope in our children? Filled with engaging dialogue and pictures from Jane\u2019s storied career, The Book of Hope is a deeply personal conversation with one of the most beloved figures in today\u2019s world.\n\nAnd for the first time, Jane tells the story of how she became a messenger of hope: from living through World War II, to her years in Gombe, to realizing she had to leave the forest to travel the world in her role as an advocate for environmental justice. She details the forces that shaped her hopeful worldview, her thoughts on her past, and her revelations about her next \u2014 and perhaps final \u2014 adventure.\n\nThere is still hope, and this book will help guide us to it.",

            "text": "It's no longer safe for Harry at Hogwarts, so he and his best friends, Ron and Hermione, are on the run. Professor Dumbledore has given them clues about what they need to do to defeat the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, once and for all, but it's up to them to figure out what these hints and suggestions really mean. Their cross-country odyssey has them searching desperately for the answers, while evading capture or death at every turn. At the same time, their friendship, fortitude, and sense of right and wrong are tested in ways they never could have imagined. The ultimate battle between good and evil that closes out this final chapter of the epic series takes place where Harry's Wizarding life began: at Hogwarts. The satisfying conclusion offers shocking last-minute twists, incredible acts of courage, powerful new forms of magic, and the resolution of many mysteries. Above all, this intense, cathartic book serves as a clear statement of the message at the heart of the Harry Potter series: that choice matters much more than destiny, and that love will always triumph over death.\n \n Series Information: Eleven-year-old Harry Potter is an orphan living with his cruel aunt and uncle when he makes a discovery that will change his life forever: he is a wizard. He is whisked away to the mystical Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magical skills, from potions to spells to flying on broomsticks. But an evil power is rising, the same one that threatened to destroy the entire world when Harry was only a baby. As Harry learns the truth about his family, his childhood, and his mysterious lightning-bolt-shaped scar, he finds unforgettable friendship, a loving surrogate family, and the courage to face the darkest force ever to menace the wizarding world. These charming and engrossing books bring an intensely detailed and captivating world to life and are perfect for enjoying individually or reading aloud."

But his botched creature, rejected by Frankenstein and denied human companionship, sets out to destroy his maker and all that he holds dear. Mary Shelley's chilling Gothic tale was conceived when she was only eighteen, living with her lover Percy Shelley near Byron's villa on Lake Geneva.

This revised edition includes as appendices a select collation of the texts of 1818 and 1831 together with 'A Fragment' by Lord Byron and Dr John Polidori's 'The Vampyre: A Tale'.",

As a species, we are both far too powerful and not nearly powerful enough, a paradox that came into sharp focus as we faced a global pandemic that both separated us and bound us together.\n\nJohn Green\u2019s gift for storytelling shines throughout this masterful collection. The Anthropocene Reviewed is a open-hearted exploration of the paths we forge and an unironic celebration of falling in love with the world.",

        "brief": "Se houve algum homem que se aproximou do ideal de \"rei-fil\u00f3sofo\" da Rep\u00fablica de Plat\u00e3o, e conseguiu ser bem sucedido tanto na condu\u00e7\u00e3o do Estado quanto no caminho da filosofia, este homem foi Marco Aur\u00e9lio, imperador de Roma. Ele foi o \u00faltimo dos cinco imperadores que governaram o Imp\u00e9rio Romano num per\u00edodo conhecido como Pax Romana (Paz Romana), que durou at\u00e9 a sua morte, em 180 d.C. Curiosamente, a \u00faltima d\u00e9cada de sua vida foi quase toda dedicada a defender o Imp\u00e9rio de invasores b\u00e1rbaros \u2013 havia paz dentro do Imp\u00e9rio, mas n\u00e3o em suas fronteiras.\n \n Devido a haver sido educado pelos melhores mentores e s\u00e1bios de sua \u00e9poca, Marco Aur\u00e9lio conheceu a fundo a filosofia grega, e veio a se apaixonar pelo estoicismo, particularmente pela obra de Epicteto. Sem d\u00favida teria sido mais simples se dedicar \u00e0 filosofia estoica no espa\u00e7o reservado de uma escola filos\u00f3fica, mas isto n\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel ao imperador Marco Aur\u00e9lio, que tinha literalmente o maior imp\u00e9rio de seu tempo dependendo dos seus cuidados. O fato de ele ter sido bem sucedido em seu caminho filos\u00f3fico, mesmo diante de tantas responsabilidades e atribula\u00e7\u00f5es, faz dele quase que um exemplo de homem divino, embora ele pr\u00f3prio pouco se importasse com a fama.\n \n Ali\u00e1s, Marco Aur\u00e9lio jamais desejou publicar obra alguma. As suas Medita\u00e7\u00f5es, que tinham a si mesmo como destinat\u00e1rio, eram nada mais que di\u00e1rios pessoais, escritos sabe-se l\u00e1 a qual custo em meio ao seu governo. De fato, ele passou os \u00faltimos dez anos de sua vida residindo longe do conforto de Roma, defendendo a fronteira norte do Imp\u00e9rio dos ataques de povos b\u00e1rbaros. E ao que tudo indica foi precisamente nesses anos, quem sabe para ajudar a si mesmo a ser resiliente a guerra, quem sabe por puro amor a filosofia, que Marco Aur\u00e9lio escreveu e presenteou a hist\u00f3ria da filosofia com esta obra.\n \n\u2014 O tradutor.",

Usando exemplos de pol\u00edtica, filmes, fic\u00e7\u00e3o, trabalho e educa\u00e7\u00e3o, argumenta que o \u201crealismo capitalista\u201d captura todas as \u00e1reas da experi\u00eancia contempor\u00e2nea. Mas tamb\u00e9m mostra que, devido a uma s\u00e9rie de inconsist\u00eancias e falhas internas ao programa de realidade do Capital, o capitalismo \u00e9, de fato, tudo \u2014 menos realista.\n\n\u201cRealismo capitalista\u201d revela que a ideologia est\u00e1 hoje assentada positiva e diretamente na crueza material do capital. Sobre um ch\u00e3o a partir do qual n\u00e3o se veem alternativas no horizonte, ocorre que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel revolver o solo: a fratura e a revolu\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e3o estruturalmente sob os p\u00e9s.\n\u2014 Alysson Leandro Mascaro, professor da USP\n\n\u201cUm cl\u00e1ssico cult\u201d.\n\u2014 Hua Hsu, The New Yorker\n\n\u201cUma leitura r\u00e1pida e divertida\u201d.\n\u2014 Socialist Standard\n\n\u201cUma leitura provocativa e necess\u00e1ria\u2026 para quem quiser falar seriamente sobre a pol\u00edtica da educa\u00e7\u00e3o hoje\u201d.\n\u2014 Times Higher Educational Supplement\n\n\u201cMark Fisher foi o l\u00edder intelectual de uma gera\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d\n\u2014 Alex Niven, New Staterman\n\n\u201cMark Fisher foi prol\u00edfico, penetrante, espirituoso, humano e on\u00edvoro\u201d\n\u2014 Meagan Day, Jacobin",

Jeevan Chaudhary, a paparazzo-turned-EMT, is in the audience and leaps to his aid. A child actress named Kirsten Raymonde watches in horror as Jeevan performs CPR, pumping Arthur's chest as the curtain drops, but Arthur is dead. That same night, as Jeevan walks home from the theater, a terrible flu begins to spread. Hospitals are flooded and Jeevan and his brother barricade themselves inside an apartment, watching out the window as cars clog the highways, gunshots ring out, and life disintegrates around them.\n\nFifteen years later, Kirsten is an actress with the Traveling Symphony. Together, this small troupe moves between the settlements of an altered world, performing Shakespeare and music for scattered communities of survivors. Written on their caravan, and tattooed on Kirsten's arm is a line from Star Trek: \"Because survival is insufficient.\" But when they arrive in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who digs graves for anyone who dares to leave.\n\nSpanning decades, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, this suspenseful, elegiac novel is rife with beauty. As Arthur falls in and out of love, as Jeevan watches the newscasters say their final good-byes, and as Kirsten finds herself caught in the crosshairs of the prophet, we see the strange twists of fate that connect them all. A novel of art, memory, and ambition, Station Eleven tells a story about the relationships that sustain us, the ephemeral nature of fame, and the beauty of the world as we know it. ",

More than five years in creation, it is a novel unlike any other.\n\nA rich and complex interweaving of story and fable, poem, artwork, and music, it totally immerses the reader in the culture of the Kesh, a peaceful people of the far future who inhabit a place called the Valley on the Northern Pacific Coast. The author makes the inhabitants of the valley as familiar, as immediate, as wholly human as our own friends or family.\n\nSpiraling outward from the dramatic life story of a woman called Stone Telling, Le Guin's Always Coming Home interweaves wry wit, deep insight and extraordinary compassion into a compelling unity of vision.",

Featuring gorgeous hand-drawn illustrations, Where the Water Tastes Like Wine combines 2D visuals with a 3D overworld US map.\n\nPlayers wander across a folkloric Depression era United States at their own pace, meeting strangers with their own stories to tell. Through these interactions, players will be able to collect unique stories which can then be re-told to unlock new interactions. In this way the in-game stories themselves act as a currency to progress through the game, and it\u2019s up to the player to pair the right story with the unique needs of each of the characters that you will encounter throughout your travels. Only through these right pairings will characters reveal their true selves, and bestow you with the most powerful stories, the true ones which reveal something about their own lives. In Where The Water Tastes Like Wine, stories organically take on a life of their own as they grow larger and transform as they're told- and re-told.",

Beim Rhythmus-Gameplay brauchst du nur zwei Tasten: hoch und runter. Einfach zu verstehen! Das Komplizierte ist die Umsetzung. Versuche, dich nicht erschlagen zu lassen.\n \n Ein Teil des Spiels besteht darin, herumzulaufen und die Dinge in deinem eigenen Tempo zu tun. Der andere Teil besteht darin, mit anderen Schritt zu halten. \n\n Das pinkhaarige M\u00e4dchen ist Beat. Das bist du. Du hast viel um die Ohren. Die Polizisten sind \u00fcberall und sie scheinen es ganz ohne Grund auf dich abgesehen zu haben. Vielleicht liegt es ja daran, dass du dich st\u00e4ndig mit Leuten anfreundest, die die Polizei aus gutem Grund im Visier hat. Aber was wei\u00df ich schon? \n\n Sprich mit Leuten, hilf ihnen (oder auch nicht, ich bin nicht deine Mutter!), spiele gro\u00dfe Konzerte und schlage Polizisten.

Keine Ahnung, was da genau los ist?!?!\n \n Das alles gipfelt in epischen Szenen, in denen alles auf dem Spiel steht. Die Musik hat dich hierhergebracht. Sie wird dich auch durchbringen.\n \n  *1999 h\u00e4tte man diesen Abschnitt \u201eLass deinen Worten Rockmusik folgen\u201c genannt. \n  \n UNBEATABLEs vollst\u00e4ndiger Arcade-Modus ist ein eigenst\u00e4ndiges Spiel mit eigenem Fortschrittssystem und vollst\u00e4ndiger Onlinekomponente.

        "brief": "You know, when you explain an idea, the idea fundamentally changes. \n \nUNBEATABLE is an anime-juiced rhythm adventure where you (figuratively) destroy on stage while you (literally) destroy on stage. During rhythm gameplay, you only need two buttons: a button for up and a button for down. Simple to understand! The complicated part is doing it. Try not to get destroyed yourself.\n \n Half the game is walking around and taking things at your own pace. The other half is trying to keep up with ours. \n\n The pink-haired girl is Beat, and she is you, and you have a lot of things to worry about. The cops are everywhere, and they are mad at you for what feels like no good reason. Though it doesn't help your case that you keep making friends with people that the cops are mad at for slightly better reasons. But what do I know? \n\n Talk to people, help them out (or don't, I'm not your mom!), play huge concerts, and punch cops. And then run away from the cops you punched. Also there are monsters or something. Not sure what's going on there?!?!\n \n All of this culminates in massive setpieces where everything is at stake. The music got you here. It'll get you through it.\n \n  *if this was 1999 this section would be called \"talk the talk and rock the rock\" \n\n UNBEATABLE's full arcade mode is an entire game by itself with its own progression system and a full online component. There's modifiers, tons of songs (with more to come!) and a whole challenge board to beat, with things to do that range from as simple as \"beat a song on easy mode\" to, one may presume, something as complicated as \"solve an ancient riddle while skateboarding.\" That's not a real example.\n \n  **if this was 1999 this section would be called \"party like it's now\" \n \n  FEATURES: \n \n\u2022 Characters that hate you!\n\u2022 Maybe also some that don't!\n\u2022 The arcade mode has a cute little profile you can customize and unlock stuff for and I think that's pretty neat\n\u2022 Graphics! We'd describe them but I mean it's right there, you can see it\n\u2022 A whole entire double album worth of original songs\n\u2022 plus acoustic versions of those songs\n\u2022 oh and also remixes, too \n\u2022 You can unlock all the songs by playing the narrative OR just by playing the arcade game exclusively! Great for those who truly hate stories\n\u2022 Something (in this game) will make you feel something (in real life)!\n\u2022 It's anime\n\u2022 If you think about it, QTEs are basically just rhythm games with no music\n\u2022 Please, whatever you do, the title is either all caps or no caps. Be kind to us.\n\u2022 And the idea changes you in return.",

It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\nTwo expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.\n\nGrand Theft Auto IV follows the story of Niko Bellic, a veteran of an unnamed war in Eastern Europe, who is haunted by the betrayal of his 15 man army unit. Ten years later, after a smuggling run goes bad due to a betrayal from a partner, Niko leaves Eastern Europe to escape the anger of his employer, Ray Bulgarin. After six months in the merchant navy (serving aboard the cargo ship the Platypus), and believing the stories of his cousin Roman, Niko comes to Liberty City to pursue the American Dream as well as searching for the traitor of his unit. After his arrival, however, Niko quickly learns that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loansharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion.",

        "brief": "Grand Theft Auto IV is an action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\nTwo expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.\n\nGrand Theft Auto IV follows the story of Niko Bellic, a veteran of an unnamed war in Eastern Europe, who is haunted by the betrayal of his 15 man army unit. Ten years later, after a smuggling run goes bad due to a betrayal from a partner, Niko leaves Eastern Europe to escape the anger of his employer, Ray Bulgarin. After six months in the merchant navy (serving aboard the cargo ship the Platypus), and believing the stories of his cousin Roman, Niko comes to Liberty City to pursue the American Dream as well as searching for the traitor of his unit. After his arrival, however, Niko quickly learns that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loansharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion.",

        "brief": "Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG! \n\n You've inherited your grandfather's old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!\n \n  Features  \n\n    Turn your overgrown field into a lively farm!    \nRaise animals, grow crops, start an orchard, craft useful machines, and more! You'll have plenty of space to create the farm of your dreams. \n \n    8 Player Farming!  \nInvite 1-7 players to join you in the valley online! Players can work together to build a thriving farm, share resources, and improve the local community.  As more hands are better than one, players have the option to scale profit margin on produce sold for a more challenging experience.\n \n    Improve your skills over time.   \nAs you make your way from a struggling greenhorn to a master farmer, you'll level up in 5 different areas: farming, mining, combat, fishing, and foraging. As you progress, you'll learn new cooking and crafting recipes, unlock new areas to explore, and customize your skills by choosing from a variety of professions. \n \n    Become part of the local community.   \nWith over 30 unique characters living in Stardew Valley, you won't have a problem finding new friends! Each person has their own daily schedule, birthday, unique mini-cutscenes, and new things to say throughout the week and year. As you make friends with them, they will open up to you, ask you for help with their personal troubles, or tell you their secrets! Take part in seasonal festivals such as the luau, haunted maze, and feast of the winter star. \n \n    Explore a vast, mysterious cave.   \nAs you travel deeper underground, you'll encounter new and dangerous monsters, powerful weapons, new environments, valuable gemstones, raw materials for crafting and upgrading tools, and mysteries to be uncovered. \n \n    Breathe new life into the valley.  \nSince JojaMart opened, the old way of life in Stardew Valley has changed. Much of the town's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair. Help restore Stardew Valley to it's former glory by repairing the old community center, or take the alternate route and join forces with Joja Corporation.\n \n    Court and marry a partner to share your life on the farm with.   \nThere are 12 available bachelors and bachelorettes to woo, each with unique character progression cutscenes. Once married, your partner will live on the farm with you. Who knows, maybe you'll have kids and start a family?\n \n    Spend a relaxing afternoon at one of the local fishing spots.   \nThe waters are teeming with seasonal varieties of delicious fish. Craft bait, bobbers, and crab pots to help you in your journey toward catching every fish and becoming a local legend! \n \n    Donate artifacts and minerals to the local museum.  \n \n    Cook delicious meals and craft useful items to help you out.   \nWith over 100 cooking and crafting recipes, you'll have a wide variety of items to create. Some dishes you cook will even give you temporary boosts to skills, running speed, or combat prowess. Craft useful objects like scarecrows, oil makers, furnaces, or even the rare and expensive crystalarium. \n \n    Customize the appearance of your character and house.   \nWith hundreds of decorative items to choose from, you'll have no trouble creating the home of your dreams!\n \n    Xbox controller support (with rumble)!

According to The Final Hours of Portal 2, the year is established to be \"somewhere in 2010\"\u2014twelve years after Aperture Science has been abandoned.\n\nThe game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence, about upcoming tests. Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person.[4] Chell is promised cake as her reward if she completes all test chambers.[19]\n\nChell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister; although she is designed to appear encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, tests including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the test. However, GLaDOS declares it must be euthanized in an \"emergency intelligence incinerator\" before Chell can continue.[17] Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled.[20][21]\n\nAfter Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center.[22] GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the \"party escort submission position\", lying face-first on the ground, so that a \"party associate\" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues her escape. In this section, GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center.[11][12] Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem \"The Chariot\", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and Emily Bront\u00eb's \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.[4]\n\nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas. With it removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally, with taunts and juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. Following the announcement of Portal 2, the ending was expanded in a later update. In this retroactive continuity, Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the \"party escort submission position\".[15][23]\n\nThe final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a Black Forest cake,[24] and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. The cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, causing the room to blackout.[25] As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song \"Still Alive\", which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive,[26] that her \"happy\" core was not disabled."

        "brief": "BioShock Infinite is the third game in the BioShock series. It is not a direct sequel/prequel to any of the previous BioShock games but takes place in an entirely different setting, although it shares similar features, gameplay and concepts with the previous games. BioShock Infinite features a range of environments that force the player to adapt, with different weapons and strategies for each situation. Interior spaces feature close combat with enemies, but unlike previous games set in Rapture, the setting of Infinite contains open spaces with emphasis on sniping and ranged combat against as many as fifteen enemies at once.\n\nBioShock Infinite takes place in the airborne city of Columbia in 1912, where the player assumes the role of Booker DeWitt, a disgraced ex-Pinkerton agent. Booker has been given the job of finding a mysterious and powerful woman imprisoned in Columbia since birth named Elizabeth in order to wipe his debts away, and the story follows the unlikely duo as they journey to escape the flying city while discovering its twisted secrets.",

(Special Tactics and Rescue Service) team member Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, who have been sent into the city to find the missing Bravo team. When the team is suddenly attacked by a ferocious group of mutated dogs, desperate for an escape they take shelter in the Mansion, but will they ever get out alive again? Players will need to be brave as they adventure through the dark, enclosed spaces searching out the horrors that await them. With limited ammo and survival items available gamers will need to keep their wits about them to survive the various traps and puzzles that greet them at every stage.\n\nOn July 24, 1998, a series of bizarre murders occur on the outskirts of the Midwestern town of Raccoon City. The Raccoon City Police Department's Special Tactics And Rescue Service (STARS) are assigned to investigate. After contact with Bravo Team is lost, Alpha Team is sent to investigate their disappearance. Alpha Team locates Bravo Team's crashed helicopter and land at the site, where they are attacked by a pack of monstrous dogs, killing one of the team. After Alpha Team's helicopter pilot, Brad Vickers, panics and takes off alone, the remaining members (Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Barry Burton) seek refuge in an abandoned mansion, where they split up.\n\nThe player character (Chris or Jill) finds several members of Bravo Team, including Kenneth J. Sullivan being eaten by a zombie; Richard Aiken, who is either killed by a giant venomous snake or eaten by a shark; Forest Speyer, who is found dead and revived as a zombie; and Bravo Team leader Enrico Marini, who reveals that one of Alpha Team's members is a traitor before being killed by an unseen shooter. Bravo Team survivor Rebecca Chambers joins Chris. The player character learns that a series of illegal experiments were undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority of a biomedical company Umbrella Corporation. The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion's personnel and animals to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T-virus.\n\nThe player character discovers a secret underground laboratory containing Umbrella's experiments. There, they find Jill or Chris in a cell and encounter Wesker programming a Tyrant, a humanoid bioweapon. Wesker reveals that he is a double agent working for Umbrella, and plans to use the Tyrant to kill the STARS members. In the ensuing confrontation, Wesker is apparently killed and the player character defeats the Tyrant. After activating the lab's self-destruct system, the player character reaches the heliport and contacts Brad for extraction. The ending changes depending on the player's actions at key points: in the best ending, the surviving team members escape by helicopter after defeating the Tyrant again; in the worst ending, the mansion remains intact and the player character is the sole survivor.",

        "description": "Marathon is a first-person shooter video game developed and published by Bungie, and released in December 1994 for the Apple Macintosh. The game takes place several centuries into the future in outer space and sets the player as a security officer attempting to defeat an alien invasion aboard a colony ship named the Marathon.\r\n\r\nMarathon has a well-developed storyline that is also an essential element of its gameplay, which distinguishes it from many other first-person shooters released in the 1990s that devote minimal attention to plot in favor of faster, more action-oriented gameplay. Marathon has a single-player scenario as well as a multiplayer deathmatch mode, through which up to eight players can compete against each other on the same computer network, via individually linked computers. This functionality increased anticipation for Marathon prior to release, and won the game the Macworld Game Hall of Fame Award for the best multiplayer game in 1995.\r\n\r\nMarathon is the first game in a series of three games collectively known as the Marathon Trilogy, which also includes its two sequels, Marathon 2: Durandal and Marathon Infinity, released in 1995 and 1996 respectively. In 1996, Bungie completed Super Marathon, a port of Marathon and Marathon 2 to Apple's short-lived Apple Bandai Pippin video game console.\r\n\r\nBungie released the source code of Marathon 2 in 1999 shortly before being acquired by Microsoft, which enabled the development of the Marathon Open Source Project and its enhanced version of the Marathon engine, called Aleph One allowing to play the game on modern versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux. The trilogy itself was released by Bungie as freeware in 2005.",

        "description": "In the space-colony simulation game  Oxygen Not Included  you\u2019ll find that scarcities of oxygen, warmth and sustenance are constant threats to your colony's survival. Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but  thriving...  \n \n  Just make sure you don't forget to breathe.   \n Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live.  \n It\u2019s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost.  \n Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists.  \n Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine.  \n Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly.  \n Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis.  \n Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you\u2019re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts.  \n Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds: Summon new worlds with a push of a button. Experience tons of untamed space rocks, then suffocate to death in them!\n  ",

Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live.  \n It\u2019s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost.  \n Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists.  \n Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine.  \n Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly.  \n Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis.  \n Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you\u2019re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts.  \n Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds: Summon new worlds with a push of a button.

        "brief": "In the space-colony simulation game  Oxygen Not Included  you\u2019ll find that scarcities of oxygen, warmth and sustenance are constant threats to your colony's survival. Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but  thriving...  \n \n  Just make sure you don't forget to breathe.   \n Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live.  \n It\u2019s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost.  \n Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists.  \n Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine.  \n Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease.

The basic premise is to lead the main character Mr. ESC, an escapologist, out of hospitals, underground facilities, offices and other buildings within the given time limit. Along the way, the player will be hindered by obstacles such as fires, earthquakes, floods, or even meteor showers. Sometimes the player must also help trapped individuals escape, which will take quick thinking and planning ahead to exit the building successfully.",

Despite the commercial success of Clarkson's debut album Thankful (2003), music critics still continued to typecast her as an American Idol gagnant and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, she collaborated with a range of new songwriters and producers such as Dr. Luke, Max Martin, John Shanks, Kara DioGuardi, and with former Evanescence members Ben Moody and David Hodges. This overhaul also led her to part ways with her manager Simon Fuller and hire the management services of Jeff Kwatinetz before the album's release. ",

It is scheduled to be released on 20 November 2015, through XL Recordings. Following the release and international success of Adele's second studio album 21 (2011), she had planned to quit the music industry and go out on a positive note. However, Adele decided to take a hiatus instead and raise her son. During her sabbatical, she suffered with writer's block and rescheduled the album's studio sessions fearing she had lost her ability to write songs. In 2013, Adele had a breakthrough and the material that eventually became 25 manifested, with writing and recording continuing through to 2015. According to the singer, the album's title is a reflection of her when she was 25 and the frame of mind she was in during that age.\nThe lead single, \"Hello\", was a critical and commercial success, topping the charts in 26 countries including the United Kingdom and the United States, where \"Hello\" became the first single to sell one-million downloads in a release week.",

It is scheduled to be released on 20 November 2015, through XL Recordings. Following the release and international success of Adele's second studio album 21 (2011), she had planned to quit the music industry and go out on a positive note. However, Adele decided to take a hiatus instead and raise her son. During her sabbatical, she suffered with writer's block and rescheduled the album's studio sessions fearing she had lost her ability to write songs. In 2013, Adele had a breakthrough and the material that eventually became 25 manifested, with writing and recording continuing through to 2015. According to the singer, the album's title is a reflection of her when she was 25 and the frame of mind she was in during that age.\nThe lead single, \"Hello\", was a critical and commercial success, topping the charts in 26 countries including the United Kingdom and the United States, where \"Hello\" became the first single to sell one-million downloads in a release week."

Then again, Lauper's voice suits her musical persona, since its chirpiness adds depth, or reconfigures the songs, whether it's the call to arms of \u0026Girls Just Want to Have Fun\u0026 or the tearjerking \u0026Time After Time.\u0026 Lauper is at her very best on the first side, all of which were singles or received airplay, and this collection of songs -- \u0026Money Changes Everything,\u0026 \u0026Girls,\u0026 \u0026When You Were Mine,\u0026 \u0026Time,\u0026 \u0026She Bop,\u0026 \u0026All Through the Night\u0026 -- is astonishing in its consistency, so strong that it makes the remaining tracks -- all enjoyable, but rather pedestrian -- charming by their association with songs so brilliantly alive. If Lauper couldn't maintain this level of consistency, it's because this captured her persona better than anyone could imagine -- when a debut captures a personality so well, let alone a personality so tied to its time, the successive work can't help but pale in comparison. Still, when it's captured as brightly and brilliantly as it is here, it does result in a debut that retains its potency, long after its production seems a little dated.",

        "brief": "One of the great new wave/early MTV records, She's So Unusual is a giddy mix of self-confidence, effervescent popcraft, unabashed sentimentality, subversiveness, and clever humor. In short, it's a multifaceted portrait of a multifaceted talent, an artist that's far more clever than her thin, deliberately girly voice would indicate. Then again, Lauper's voice suits her musical persona, since its chirpiness adds depth, or reconfigures the songs, whether it's the call to arms of \u0026Girls Just Want to Have Fun\u0026 or the tearjerking \u0026Time After Time.\u0026 Lauper is at her very best on the first side, all of which were singles or received airplay, and this collection of songs -- \u0026Money Changes Everything,\u0026 \u0026Girls,\u0026 \u0026When You Were Mine,\u0026 \u0026Time,\u0026 \u0026She Bop,\u0026 \u0026All Through the Night\u0026 -- is astonishing in its consistency, so strong that it makes the remaining tracks -- all enjoyable, but rather pedestrian -- charming by their association with songs so brilliantly alive. If Lauper couldn't maintain this level of consistency, it's because this captured her persona better than anyone could imagine -- when a debut captures a personality so well, let alone a personality so tied to its time, the successive work can't help but pale in comparison. Still, when it's captured as brightly and brilliantly as it is here, it does result in a debut that retains its potency, long after its production seems a little dated.",

My wish is also my command. \n\nBeing chronically ill means you have the best seat on the perpetual struggle bus. Thanks to the very sexy diagnosis of end-stage kidney disease I was always missing out: on my dream writing career, finding love (bah humbug, but one can hope\u2026right?)\u2026even literally missing my daily train to get to work because I\u2019d trip and fall on my cane. Classic Jane: basketcase. \n\nBut thanks to a black-market kidney donation giving me mysterious powers, the tables have turned. Now I get drinks on the house, dates whenever I want them, writing opportunities that actually pay the bills\u2026 for the first time, people take me seriously. Because I make them. \n\nThe downside? (There always is one.) Keeping the truth hidden. That\u2019s where my new crew comes in: individually, we\u2019re a bunch of freaks with secrets no one in our lives can know, but together, we\u2019re the ones finally running the show.\n\nPower Trip is a Realm production starring Tatiana Maslany, written by Mary Hamilton, additional writing by Cara Horner, and featuring performances by Brendan Hines and Lisa Loeb.

Han bliver hjulpet af sine tre venner katara, sokka og toph, dog efter bog 3 kapitel 11, bliver han ogs\u00e5 hjulpet p\u00e5 vej af sin tidligere fjende zuko. For 100 \u00e5r siden startede ildmesteren en strid mod de andre tre nationer. Avataren er den eneste person, der kan mestre alle fire elementer. Det er kun ham, der vil v\u00e6re i stand til at standse ildmesteren, s\u00e5 der igen kan blive balance i verden. Problemet er, at avataren er kun en lille 12-\u00e5rig dreng, som hedder aang, og at han er under tidspres af en komet, der vil kunne give ildmesteren kraft nok til at kunne afslutte krigen selv."
