But it also demonstrates the unbending consistency that unites his life and work: the ongoing reinvention of living conception of Marxism, and a respect for the still untapped potential of mass self-rule.", "id": "https://eggplant.place/book/13zMu7wlDYzLLA9cbHqPEQ", "uuid": "13zMu7wlDYzLLA9cbHqPEQ", "url": "/book/13zMu7wlDYzLLA9cbHqPEQ", "api_url": "/api/book/13zMu7wlDYzLLA9cbHqPEQ", "category": "book", "parent_uuid": "1mzgcRWS1B42Cq3VqDSFRa", "display_title": "Decolonial Marxism: Essays from the Pan-African Revolution", "external_resources": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57186849"}]}, {"type": "Edition", "title": "The Story of Jane", "description": "An extraordinary history by one of its members, this is the first account of Jane's evolution, the conflicts within the group, and the impact its work had both on the women it helped and the members themselves.

Em 2017, Drauzio encerra sua trilogia liter\u00e1ria sobre o sistema carcer\u00e1rio brasileiro com Prisioneiras. Al\u00e7ando as mulheres encarceradas a protagonistas, o m\u00e9dico rememora os \u00faltimos onze anos de atendimento na Penitenci\u00e1ria Feminina da Capital, que abriga mais de duas mil detentas. S\u00e3o hist\u00f3rias de mulheres que n\u00e3o raro entram para o crime por conta de seus parceiros - inclusive tentando levar drogas aos companheiros nas penitenci\u00e1rias masculinas em dias de visita -, mas que s\u00e3o esquecidas quando est\u00e3o atr\u00e1s das grades. As fam\u00edlias conseguem tolerar um encarcerado, mas n\u00e3o uma m\u00e3e, irm\u00e3, filha ou esposa na cadeia. No ambiente carcer\u00e1rio feminino, h\u00e1 elementos comuns \u00e0s penitenci\u00e1rias masculinas. Assim como no Carandiru, um c\u00f3digo de leis n\u00e3o escrito rege as prisioneiras; o Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC) est\u00e1 presente e mostra sua for\u00e7a atrav\u00e9s das mulheres que integram a fac\u00e7\u00e3o; e a rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre aquelas que habitam as cadeias n\u00e3o \u00e9 menos complexa. As casas de deten\u00e7\u00e3o femininas, no entanto, guardam suas particularidades - diferen\u00e7as \u00e0s quais o m\u00e9dico paulistano dedica aten\u00e7\u00e3o especial em sua narrativa. Desde a din\u00e2mica dos atendimentos e a escassez de visitas at\u00e9 os relacionamentos entre as presas, fica n\u00edtido que a realidade das pris\u00f5es escapa ao imagin\u00e1rio de quem vive fora delas. Prisioneiras \u00e9 um relato franco, sem julgamentos morais, que n\u00e3o perde o senso cr\u00edtico em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s mazelas da sociedade brasileira. Nesse encerramento de ciclo, Drauzio Varella reafirma seu talento de escritor do cotidiano, retratando sua experi\u00eancia e a vida dessas mulheres com a mesma disposi\u00e7\u00e3o, coragem e sensibilidade que empreendeu ao iniciar seu trabalho nas pris\u00f5es h\u00e1 quase tr\u00eas d\u00e9cadas.", "id": "https://eggplant.place/book/3EWd6KHPfhN9ownq9VopQ7", "uuid": "3EWd6KHPfhN9ownq9VopQ7", "url": "/book/3EWd6KHPfhN9ownq9VopQ7", "api_url": "/api/book/3EWd6KHPfhN9ownq9VopQ7", "category": "book", "parent_uuid": "18bsjPdppdsXqZOoVdAlQG", "display_title": "Prisioneiras", "external_resources": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35062389"}]}, {"type": "Edition", "title": "Imperador Deus de Duna", "description": "Mil\u00eanios se passaram em Arrakis desde os eventos narrados em Duna, e o planeta, que antes era des\u00e9rtico, agora est\u00e1 verdejante e vigoroso.
