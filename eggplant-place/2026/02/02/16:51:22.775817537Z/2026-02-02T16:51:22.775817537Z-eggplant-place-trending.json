But his botched creature, rejected by Frankenstein and denied human companionship, sets out to destroy his maker and all that he holds dear. Mary Shelley's chilling Gothic tale was conceived when she was only eighteen, living with her lover Percy Shelley near Byron's villa on Lake Geneva. It would become the world's most famous work of horror fiction, and remains a devastating exploration of the limits of human creativity.\n\nBased on the third edition of 1831, this volume contains all the revisions Mary Shelley made to her story, as well as her 1831 introduction and Percy Bysshe Shelley's preface to the first edition. This revised edition includes as appendices a select collation of the texts of 1818 and 1831 together with 'A Fragment' by Lord Byron and Dr John Polidori's 'The Vampyre: A Tale'.",

Y ese es el motor que hay detr\u00e1s del atrevido plan que otorga a cuatro hombres enormes recursos para dise\u00f1ar unas estrategias secretas, ocultas a trav\u00e9s del enga\u00f1o tanto de la Tierra como de Trisolaris. Tres de esos hombres son influyentes y cient\u00edficos, pero el cuarto es un completo desconocido. Luo Ji, un ambicioso astr\u00f3nomo y soci\u00f3logo chino, est\u00e1 desconcertado por su nueva condici\u00f3n. Lo \u00fanico que sabe es que \u00e9l es el \u00fanico\u2026",

        "description": "Riveting, rousing, and utterly real,  Surpassing Certainty  is a portrait of a young woman searching for her purpose and place in the world--without a road map to guide her. \n \n The journey begins a few months before her twentieth birthday. Janet Mock is adjusting to her days as a first-generation college student at the University of Hawaii and her nights as a dancer at a strip club. Finally content in her body, she vacillates between flaunting and concealing herself as she navigates dating and disclosure, sex and intimacy, and most important, letting herself be truly  seen . Under the neon lights of Club Nu, Janet meets Troy, a yeoman stationed at Pearl Harbor naval base, who becomes her  first . The pleasures and perils of their union serve as a backdrop for Janet's progression through her early twenties with all the universal growing pains--falling in and out of love, living away from home, and figuring out what she wants to  do  with her life.\n \n Despite her disadvantages, fueled by her dreams and inimitable drive, Janet makes her way through New York City while holding her truth close. She builds a career in the highly competitive world of magazine publishing--within the unique context of being trans, a woman, and a person of color.\n \n Long before she became one of the world's most respected media figures and lauded leaders for equality and justice, Janet was a girl taking the time she needed to just  be --to learn how to advocate for herself before becoming an advocate for others. As you witness Janet slow-won success and painful failures,  Surpassing Certainty  will embolden you, shift the way you see others, and affirm your journey in search of self.",

Marxist analyses tend to presuppose European models of history and experience that downplay the significance of black people and black communities as agents of change and resistance. Black radicalism must be linked to the traditions of Africa and the unique experiences of blacks on western continents, Robinson argues, and any analyses of African American history need to acknowledge this.\n \n To illustrate his argument, Robinson traces the emergence of Marxist ideology in Europe, the resistance by blacks in historically oppressive environments, and the influence of both of these traditions on such important twentieth-century black radical thinkers as W.

He was not only a witness of a Pan-African and socialist internationalism; in his efforts to build mass organizations, catalyze rebellious ferment, and theorize an anti-colonial path to self-emancipation, he can be counted among its prime authors. In drawing together pages where he elaborates on the nexus of race and class, offers his reflections on radical pedagogy, outlines programs for newly independent nation-states, considers the challenges of anti-colonial historiography, and produces balance sheets for a dozen wars for national liberation, this volume captures something of the range and power of Rodney's output.

        "brief": "Mil\u00eanios se passaram em Arrakis desde os eventos narrados em Duna, e o planeta, que antes era des\u00e9rtico, agora est\u00e1 verdejante e vigoroso. O Imperador Deus de Duna, que garantiu uma paz for\u00e7ada em todos os planetas, consegue entender o futuro, e sabe, com uma terr\u00edvel certeza, que sua ra\u00e7a ser\u00e1 extinta a menos que ele crie novas qualidades para a esp\u00e9cie. As regras do Imperador n\u00e3o s\u00e3o benevolentes. Sua transforma\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o deixou apenas sua apar\u00eancia desumana, mas tamb\u00e9m seu senso de moral. Nasce ent\u00e3o uma rebeli\u00e3o para se opor ao d\u00e9spota, liderada por Siona, da fam\u00edlia Atreides. Mas Siona n\u00e3o sabe que a vis\u00e3o do Imperador para o Caminho Dourado exige que ela aceite um destino que nunca quis ou que algum dia poderia conceber. Narrado sob uma \u00f3tica particular, Imperador Deus de Duna inicia um novo arco de hist\u00f3ria na saga. Neste quarto volume, Frank Herbert apresenta um de seus personagens mais marcantes e discute temas como pol\u00edtica, religi\u00e3o, amor e os rumos tomados pela sociedade.",

        "description": "Everyone needs to love and be loved\u2014even men. But to know love, men must be able to look at the ways that patriarchal culture keeps them from knowing themselves, from being in touch with their feelings, from loving.\n\nIn The Will to Change, bell hooks gets to the heart of the matter and shows men how to express the emotions that are a fundamental part of who they are\u2014whatever their age, marital status, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. But toxic masculinity punishes those fundamental emotions, and it\u2019s so deeply ingrained in our society that it\u2019s hard for men to not comply\u2014but hooks wants to help change that.\n\nWith trademark candor and fierce intelligence, hooks addresses the most common concerns of men, such as fear of intimacy and loss of their patriarchal place in society, in new and challenging ways. She believes men can find the way to spiritual unity by getting back in touch with the emotionally open part of themselves\u2014and lay claim to the rich and rewarding inner lives that have historically been the exclusive province of women. A brave and astonishing work, The Will to Change is designed to help men reclaim the best part of themselves.",

Its truths are so enduring that its language has become part of the common Russian speech.\nOne hot spring, the devil arrives in Moscow, accompanied by a retinue that includes a beautiful naked witch and an immense talking black cat with a fondness for chess and vodka. The visitors quickly wreak havoc in a city that refuses to believe in either God or Satan. But they also bring peace to two unhappy Muscovites: one is the Master, a writer pilloried for daring to write a novel about Christ and Pontius Pilate; the other is Margarita, who loves the Master so deeply that she is willing literally to go to hell for him. What ensues is a novel of in exhaustible energy, humor, and philosophical depth, a work whose nuances emerge for the first time in Diana Burgin's and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor's splendid English version.\n(back cover)",

We follow him through public school and Cambridge, and on into his father's firm, Hill and Hall, Stock Brokers. In a highly structured society, Maurice is a conventional young man in almost every way, \"stepping into the niche that England had prepared for him\": except that his is homosexual. Written during 1913 and 1914, immediately after \"Howards End,\" and not published until 1971, \" Maurice\" was ahead of its time in its theme and in its affirmation that love between men can be happy. \"Happiness,\" Forster wrote, \"is its keynote. In \"Maurice\" I tried to create a character who was completely unlike myself or what I supposed myself to be: someone handsome, healthy, bodily attractive, mentally torpid, not a bad businessman and rather a snob.

        "brief": "Maurice is heartbroken over unrequited love, which opened his heart and mind to his own sexual identity. In order to be true to himself, he goes against the grain of society\u2019s often unspoken rules of class, wealth, and politics.\n \n Forster understood that his homage to same-sex love, if published when he completed it in 1914, would probably end his career. Thus,  Maurice  languished in a drawer for fifty-seven years, the author requesting it be published only after his death (along with his stories about homosexuality later collected in  The Life to Come ).\n \n Since its release in 1971,  Maurice  has been widely read and praised. It has been, and continues to be, adapted for major stage productions, including the 1987 Oscar-nominated film adaptation starring Hugh Grant and James Wilby.",

According to The Final Hours of Portal 2, the year is established to be \"somewhere in 2010\"\u2014twelve years after Aperture Science has been abandoned.\n\nThe game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence, about upcoming tests. Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person.[4] Chell is promised cake as her reward if she completes all test chambers.[19]\n\nChell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister; although she is designed to appear encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, tests including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the test. However, GLaDOS declares it must be euthanized in an \"emergency intelligence incinerator\" before Chell can continue.[17] Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled.[20][21]\n\nAfter Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center.[22] GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the \"party escort submission position\", lying face-first on the ground, so that a \"party associate\" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues her escape. In this section, GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center.[11][12] Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem \"The Chariot\", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and Emily Bront\u00eb's \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.[4]\n\nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas. With it removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally, with taunts and juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. Following the announcement of Portal 2, the ending was expanded in a later update. In this retroactive continuity, Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the \"party escort submission position\".[15][23]\n\nThe final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a Black Forest cake,[24] and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. The cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, causing the room to blackout.[25] As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song \"Still Alive\", which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive,[26] that her \"happy\" core was not disabled."

Players assume the role of V, a mercenary outlaw in pursuit of a unique implant that holds the key to immortality. The game allows extensive customization of cyberware, skills, and playstyle. Choices made throughout the journey influence both the narrative and the world.\n\nIn 2077, following an economic collapse sometime during the early 21st century, the United States is forced to rely on large corporations to survive. These corporations deal in a wide range of areas, such as weapons, robotics, cybernetics, pharmaceuticals, communications and biotechnology, and many of these companies operate above the law. The world in between is where decadence, sex and pop culture mix with violent crime, extreme poverty and the unattainable promise of the American Dream. You play as V, a mercenary outlaw deeply embedded in the crime-ridden city of Night City, going after a one-of-a-kind implant that is the key to immortality.",

            "text": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an open-world action role-playing game developed by CD Projekt Red.\n\nSet in a dark fantasy world, the game follows Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter searching for his adopted daughter, Ciri, while navigating political conflicts and supernatural threats. Gameplay features exploration, combat, character progression, and branching narratives shaped by player choices. Widely acclaimed for its writing, world-building, and depth, it is considered one of the most influential RPGs of its generation.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt concludes the story of the witcher Geralt of Rivia, the series' protagonist, whose story to date has been covered in the previous installments. Geralt's new mission comes in dark times as the mysterious and otherworldly army known as the Wild Hunt invades the Northern Kingdoms, leaving only blood soaked earth and fiery ruin in its wake; and it seems the Witcher is the key to stopping their cataclysmic rampage."

Bahne dir deinen Weg in die Welt, Turm f\u00fcr Turm, Mauer f\u00fcr Mauer, und forme sie aus den bedrohlichen Klippen und gef\u00e4hrlichen Gew\u00e4ssern einer unbarmherzigen Landschaft, die sich nicht z\u00e4hmen l\u00e4sst. \n  \nSpielziele:  Entwerfe fantastische Festungssiedlungen auf dem Ozean. Der Fortschritt ist einfach: Wachse die Populationen verschiedener Fraktionen und du wirst in ihren Seelenb\u00e4umen voranschreiten, indem du Kommandanten und Kapit\u00e4ne freischaltest, die f\u00fcr dich arbeiten k\u00f6nnen, und neue Schiffe, Einheiten und F\u00e4higkeiten freischaltest. \n  \nSpiele auf deine Weise: Es gibt drei separate Spielmodi, die unterschiedliche Spielerlebnisse bieten. \n  \nBulwark - Erkunde die Gro\u00dfe Ursee, w\u00e4hrend du deine gro\u00dfe Zivilisation aufbaust. Pl\u00fcndere Ressourcen, errichte Handelsrouten und schlie\u00dfe Allianzen mit anderen Fraktionen, die \u00fcber die Wellen verstreut sind, w\u00e4hrend du Verhandlung und Konflikt ausbalancierst, um deine Siedlung zu erweitern. \n  \nFreier Aufbau: Genie\u00dfe einen gem\u00fctlichen \u201eFreier Aufbau\u201c-Modus, frei von den Konflikten und Herausforderungen des Standardspiels; du kannst ohne Ressourcen skizzieren und experimentieren, ohne Einschr\u00e4nkungen bauen. \n  \nTotale Eroberung: Der Krieg ist \u00fcber die Gro\u00dfe Ursee gekommen. Du beginnst im Krieg mit jeder Fraktion, Diplomatie ist deaktiviert und die H\u00e4ufigkeit und das Ausma\u00df der \u00dcberf\u00e4lle ist erh\u00f6ht. Es reicht nicht mehr, nur zu bauen - jetzt musst du \u00fcberleben. \n  \nBaumaterialien: Holz, Stein und Eisen werden nicht gespeichert oder gez\u00e4hlt; das einzige, was z\u00e4hlt, ist die Entfernung, nicht die Kosten.

T\u00fcrme und Mauern innerhalb der Reichweite der Ressource k\u00f6nnen kostenlos aufger\u00fcstet und gebaut werden, au\u00dferhalb der Reichweite nicht. \n \nSplitter: Die W\u00e4hrung, die Diplomatie, Armeebau, den Kauf neuer Orte und einzigartiger Geb\u00e4ude antreibt, ist von Ressourcen getrennt; sie l\u00e4uft auf einer W\u00e4hrung namens Splitter. Du gewinnst sie durch Bev\u00f6lkerungswachstum, Handel mit anderen Fraktionen oder als Belohnungen aus K\u00e4mpfen. \n  \nHerausforderung: Das Spiel fordert dich heraus, gro\u00dfartige Festungen zu entwerfen und zu bauen, oft zu geringen Kosten, au\u00dfer dem Einrichten von Handelsrouten f\u00fcr Ressourcen.

Skab din vej ind i en verden, t\u00e5rn for t\u00e5rn, mur for mur, formet af de skr\u00e6mmende klipper og farlige farvande i et uforsonligt landskab, der n\u00e6gter at lade sig t\u00e6mme. \n  \nSpillets m\u00e5l: Design fantastiske bos\u00e6ttelser med havf\u00e6stninger. Fremskridt er enkelt, f\u00e5 befolkningerne i de forskellige fraktioner til at vokse, og du vil g\u00f8re fremskridt p\u00e5 deres Soultrees. L\u00e5s op for kommandanter og kaptajner, der kan arbejde for dig, og l\u00e5s op for nye skibe, enheder og evner. \n  \nSpil p\u00e5 din m\u00e5de: \n\nBulwark - Udforsk Great Ursee, mens du opbygger din store civilisation. S\u00f8g efter ressourcer, skab handelsruter og indg\u00e5 alliancer med andre fraktioner spredt ud over b\u00f8lgerne, mens du balancerer forhandling og konflikt for at f\u00e5 din bos\u00e6ttelse til at vokse. \n  \nFreebuild - Nyd den hyggelige \u00bbFreebuild Mode\u00ab, der er blottet for konflikter og udfordringer i standardspillet, hvor du kan skitsere og eksperimentere uden behov for ressourcer og bygge uden gr\u00e6nser. \n  \nTotal Conquest - Krigen er kommet til Great Ursee. Du starter i krig med alle fraktioner, diplomatiet er deaktiveret, og hyppigheden og omfanget af raids er \u00f8get. Det er ikke l\u00e6ngere nok bare at bygge - nu skal du overleve.  \n  \nByggeressourcer: Tr\u00e6, sten og jern bliver ikke opbevaret eller talt op, det eneste, der t\u00e6ller, er afstanden, ikke prisen. Du transporterer ressourcer langs dit netv\u00e6rk af t\u00e5rne og handelsruter over havet. T\u00e5rne og mure inden for ressourcens r\u00e6kkevidde kan opgraderes og bygges gratis, men ikke dem uden for r\u00e6kkevidde.  \n  \nSplinters: Den valuta, der driver diplomati, h\u00e6ropbygning, k\u00f8b af nye steder og unikke bygninger, er adskilt fra ressourcer, den k\u00f8rer p\u00e5 en valuta kaldet Splinters. Du f\u00e5r dem gennem befolkningstilv\u00e6kst, handel med andre fraktioner eller som bel\u00f8nning for kamp. \n  \nUdfordring: Spillet udfordrer dig til at designe og udbygge store f\u00e6stninger, ofte uden andre omkostninger end at etablere handelsruter for ressourcer. Efterh\u00e5nden som du vokser, kan du invitere befolkninger fra andre fraktioner, som l\u00e5ser op for fraktionsspecifikt indhold fra deres \u00bbsoultree\u00ab.  \n\nMen alle hader alle p\u00e5 Ursee, og det kan f\u00f8re til krig eller til loyale allierede, der fusionerer med dit imperium. Denne sandkassebygger har konsekvenser!"

Scolpisci il tuo cammino in un mondo, torre dopo torre, muro dopo muro, scolpendo le scoraggianti scogliere e le pericolose acque di un paesaggio spietato che si rifiuta di essere domato. \n  \nObiettivi del gioco: Progettare fantastici insediamenti-fortezza sull'oceano. I progressi sono semplici: fai crescere le popolazioni delle varie fazioni e progredirai nelle loro Soultre. Sbloccare comandanti e capitani che possono lavorare per voi, sbloccare nuove navi, unit\u00e0 e abilit\u00e0. \n  \nGioca a modo tuo:   \n  \nBulwark - Esplora il Grande Ursee mentre costruisci la tua grande civilt\u00e0. Cercate risorse, create rotte commerciali e stringete alleanze con altre fazioni sparse tra le onde, bilanciando negoziati e conflitti per far crescere il vostro insediamento. \n  \nFreebuild - Godetevi l'accogliente modalit\u00e0 \u201cFreebuild\u201d, priva dei conflitti e delle sfide presenti nel gioco standard: potrete abbozzare e sperimentare senza bisogno di risorse, costruendo senza limiti. \n  \nConquista totale - La guerra \u00e8 arrivata nel Grande Ursee. Si parte in guerra con ogni fazione, la diplomazia \u00e8 disattivata e la frequenza e la portata delle incursioni sono aumentate. Non basta pi\u00f9 costruire, ora bisogna sopravvivere.  \n  \nRisorse per la costruzione: Il legno, la pietra e il ferro non vengono immagazzinati n\u00e9 conteggiati: l'unica cosa che conta \u00e8 la distanza, non il costo. Le risorse vengono trasportate lungo la rete di torri e le rotte commerciali sul mare. Le torri e le mura che si trovano nel raggio d'azione della risorsa possono essere potenziate e costruite gratuitamente, quelle che si trovano fuori dal raggio d'azione no.  \n  \nSchegge: La valuta che alimenta la diplomazia, la costruzione dell'esercito, l'acquisto di nuove localit\u00e0 e di edifici unici \u00e8 separata dalle risorse e si basa su una valuta chiamata Schegge. Si ottengono attraverso la crescita della popolazione, il commercio con altre fazioni o come ricompensa per i combattimenti. \n  \nSfida: Il gioco vi sfida a progettare e a far crescere grandi fortezze, spesso con costi minimi se non la creazione di rotte commerciali per le risorse. Man mano che si cresce, si possono invitare popolazioni di altre fazioni, che sbloccano contenuti esclusivi della fazione dal loro \u201calbero dell'anima\u201d.  \n\nMa tutti odiano tutti sull'Ursee e questo pu\u00f2 portare alla guerra o ad alleati fedeli che si fondono con il vostro impero.

        "brief": "INTRODUCING A CREATIVE SANDBOX BUILDING GAME: Bulwark is about designing your fortress and expanding it into an empire. \n\nStory: You are in charge of the last remnants of free people on the Ursee, tasked with building a new home. Carve your path onto a world, tower by tower, wall by wall, sculpting from the daunting cliffs and perilous waters of an unforgiving landscape that refuses to be tamed.\n\nGame goals: Design fantastic ocean fortress settlements. Progress is simple, grow the populations of various factions and you will progress on their Soultrees. Unlocking commanders and captains that may work for you, unlocking new ships, units and abilities. \n\nPlay Your Way: \n\nBulwark - Explore the Great Ursee as you build your grand civilisation. Scavenge for resources,create trade routes and strike alliances with other factions scattered across the waves as you balance negotiation and conflict to grow your settlement. \n\nFreebuild - Enjoy a cosy \u2018Freebuild Mode\u2019, devoid of the conflict and challenges present in standard play, you can sketch and experiment without the need for resources, building without limits. \n  \nTotal Conquest - War has come to the Great Ursee. You start at war with every faction, diplomacy is disabled and the frequency and scale of raids is ramped up. It is no longer enough to just build - now you must survive.  \n\nBuilding Resources: Wood, stone and Iron aren\u2019t stored or tallied up, the only thing that counts is distance, not cost. You transport resources along your network of towers as well as trading routes over the sea. Towers and walls within range of the resource can be upgraded and built for free, those out of range cannot.  \n\nSplinters: The currency that powers diplomacy, army building, buying new locations and unique buildings is separate from resources, it runs on a currency called, Splinters. You gain these through population growth, trade with other factions or as rewards from combat. \n\nChallenge: The game challenges you to design and grow grand fortresses, often at little cost other than setting up trade routes for resources. As you grow you may invite in populations from other factions which unlock faction unique content from their \u201csoultree\u201d.  \n\nBut everybody hates everybody on the Ursee and doing so might lead to war or to loyal allies that merge with your empire.

        "description": "A free-roaming squad based RPG focusing on open-ended sandbox gameplay features rather than a linear story. Be a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave, or just food for the cannibals. \n \n    \n \n Research new equipment and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive. FEATURES \n       \n  Freeform gameplay in a seamless game world  in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870 square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. \n \n       \n  Custom design as many characters as you want  and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. \n \n       \n  Build a base  where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. \n \n    \n  Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre.  No \"hero\" characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. \n \n    \n  You are not the chosen one.  You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it.\n \n    \n  Purchase and upgrade your own buildings  to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. \n \n    \n  Variation and possibilities of gameplay.  Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. \n \n    \n  Dynamic, ever changing world.  Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a \"game\", you are living and surviving in a simulated world.\n \n    \n  Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive , or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. \n \n    \n  Absolutely no Level-scaling.  The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. \n \n    \n  Realistic medical system that affects gameplay.  A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character\u2019s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. \n \n    \n  Intelligent AI  that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. \n \n    \n  Aid or oppose the various factions  in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment. \n \n    \n  Independently developed  with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives. \n \n    \n  Original game world.  There are no fantasy-knock-off cliches. No magic.\n \n \n \n ",

Traslada a tus compa\u00f1eros de escuadr\u00f3n heridos a un lugar seguro y devu\u00e9lvelos a casa con vida. FEATURES \n       \n  Jugabilidad no lineal con gran libertad de acci\u00f3n en un mundo sin interrupciones  en el m\u00e1s extenso RPG para un \u00fanico jugador desde Daggerfall, cuya extensi\u00f3n supera los 870 kil\u00f3metros cuadrados. El juego nunca intentar\u00e1 limitarte ni restringir tu estilo de juego personal.\n \n       \n  Dise\u00f1a a medida tantos personajes como quieras  y crea todo un escuadr\u00f3n para que luche por ti. Los personajes crecer\u00e1n y se har\u00e1n m\u00e1s fuertes con la experiencia, no solo en las estad\u00edsticas si no en su aspecto.\n \n       \n  Crea una base  donde investigar nuevas tecnolog\u00edas, mejorar tus defensas y elaborar nuevos equipos.\n \n    \n  Versi\u00f3n original del g\u00e9nero h\u00edbrido RTS-RPG.  No hay personajes \u201ch\u00e9roes\u201d con estad\u00edsticas artificialmente m\u00e1s fuertes que el resto- Cada personaje y NPC que conoces es potencialmente un igual, y tiene un nombre, una vida.\n \n    \n  No eres el elegido.  No eres grande ni poderoso. No tienes m\u00e1s 'puntos de vida\u2019' que nadie. No eres el centro del universo, ni eres especial. A no ser que trabajes para ello.\n \n    \n  Compra y mejora tus propios edificios  para usarlos como refugios fortificados seguros cuando las cosas se pongan feas, o para emprender un negocio.\n \n    \n  Variaci\u00f3n y posibilidades de juego.  S\u00e9 bueno, s\u00e9 malvado, s\u00e9 un hombre de negocios, s\u00e9 un ladr\u00f3n, vive en un pueblo, vive en el desierto, viaja a solas, viaja en horda, construye una fortaleza, arrasa una ciudad. Ded\u00edcate a liberar esclavos o tal vez acaba siendo un esclavo.\n \n    \n  Mundo din\u00e1mico, en continuo cambio.  Apoya o entorpece a quien quieras, o ve a lo tuyo, el mundo no se detendr\u00e1. \u00c9ste no es solo un \u201cjuego\u201d, est\u00e1s viviendo y sobreviviendo en un mundo simulado.\n \n    \n  S\u00e9 capturado por can\u00edbales y comido con vida , o vendido a esclavistas y obligado a trabajar en las minas. Estos no son eventos guionizados, simplemente una parte de este ca\u00f3tico mundo que arruina tu vida por casualidad. Cualquier cosa puede suceder y la vez que todo puede ser superado si tienes la fortaleza.\n \n    \n  Sin escalado de nivel en absoluto.  El mundo no sube de nivel a la vez que t\u00fa lo haces, y las tiendas no cambian su inventario \u00fanicamente a art\u00edculos que coinciden con tu nivel. Al principio del juego casi todo el mundo ser\u00e1 m\u00e1s fuerte que t\u00fa, y la supervivencia siempre ser\u00e1 una lucha. El juego no te llevar\u00e1 de la mano ni te ayudar\u00e1 cuando hayas ca\u00eddo.\n \n    \n  Sistema m\u00e9dico realista que afecta al modo de juego.  Un personaje con una pierna herida cojear\u00e1 o se arrastrar\u00e1 y retrasar\u00e1 al grupo, tener brazos heridos supondr\u00e1 que tendr\u00e1s que usar tu espada con una sola mano o ninguna. Lesiones graves conllevar\u00e1n amputaciones y necesitar\u00e1s sustituirlos con miembros rob\u00f3ticos. La p\u00e9rdida de sangre significa que puedes desmayarte, y la sangre atraer\u00e1 a depredadores. Las estad\u00edsticas de un personaje se ven afectadas por el equipo, la carga, la p\u00e9rdida de sangre, las lesiones y el hambre.\n \n    \n  IA inteligente  que permite a los personajes razonar y trabajar en pos de objetivos y deseos a largo plazo. Los escuadrones trabajan juntos y trasladan a sus heridos a un lugar seguro. Los personajes pueden ser configurados para cuidar de la microgesti\u00f3n y encargarse de la producci\u00f3n en su base.\n \n    \n  Ayuda o enfr\u00e9ntate a las distintas facciones  en el mundo a la vez que luchas por tener la fuerza y riqueza necesarias para simplemente sobrevivir en el ambiente hostil.\n \n    \n  Desarrollado de manera independiente  sin influencias en el dise\u00f1o, ni modificaciones dictadas por hombres de trajes grises que no han jugado a un videojuego en su vida.\n \n    \n  Mundo del juego original.

S\u2019\u00e9tendant sur plus de 870 km\u00b2, le jeu n\u2019essayera jamais de vous limiter ni de restreindre votre style de jeu personnel.\n \n       \n  Cr\u00e9ez des personnages sur mesure , autant que vous le voudrez, et formez toute une escouade qui se battra pour vous. Les personnages \u00e9volueront et deviendront plus forts avec l\u2019exp\u00e9rience, pas seulement dans leurs stats mais aussi dans leur apparence.\n \n    \n  Une variante originale du genre hybride RTS-RPG . Pas de personnages \u00ab h\u00e9ros \u00bb aux stats artificiellement plus hautes que celles des autres. Tous les personnages et PNJ que vous rencontrez sont potentiellement vos \u00e9gaux et ont un nom, une vie.\n \n    \n  Vous n\u2019\u00eates pas l\u2019\u00e9lu .

Ce n\u2019est pas juste un \u00ab jeu \u00bb, vous vivez et survivez dans un monde simul\u00e9.\n \n    \n  Vous serez peut-\u00eatre captur\u00e9 par des cannibales et d\u00e9vor\u00e9 vivant,  ou vendu par des esclavagistes et forc\u00e9 de travailler dans les mines. Ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements ne sont pas sc\u00e9naris\u00e9s, ils font juste partie de ce monde chaotique qui peut d\u00e9truire votre vie compl\u00e8tement par hasard.

Un personnage bless\u00e9 \u00e0 la jambe boitera ou marchera \u00e0 quatre pattes et ralentira le groupe. Avec des blessures aux bras, vous devrez manier votre \u00e9p\u00e9e d\u2019une seule main\u2026 ou serez juste incapable de vous en servir. Les blessures graves entra\u00eeneront des amputations et les membres devront \u00eatre remplac\u00e9s par des proth\u00e8ses robotiques. La perte de sang pourra conduire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vanouissement et attirer des pr\u00e9dateurs. Les stats d\u2019un personnage seront affect\u00e9es par son mat\u00e9riel, sa charge, ses pertes de sang, ses blessures et sa faim. \n \n    \n  IA intelligente  qui permet aux personnages de raisonner et de poursuivre des buts et motivations sur le long terme. Les escouades travaillent ensemble et mettent leurs bless\u00e9s en s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Vous pouvez demander aux personnages de g\u00e9rer de nombreuses t\u00e2ches pour vous et de s\u2019occuper de la production \u00e0 votre base.\n \n    \n  Aidez ou combattez les diff\u00e9rentes factions  existant dans le monde tout en veillant \u00e0 conserver assez de forces et de richesse\u2026 Vous en aurez besoin pour survivre dans cet environnement impitoyable.\n \n    \n  D\u00e9velopp\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re ind\u00e9pendante ;  con\u00e7u sans influences ni alt\u00e9rations impos\u00e9es par des hommes en costume gris n\u2019ayant jamais jou\u00e9 \u00e0 un jeu de leur vie.\n \n    \n  Un univers de jeu original  qui n\u2019imite pas les clich\u00e9s fantasy.

Sei ein H\u00e4ndler, Dieb, Rebell, Kriegsherr, Abenteurer, Bauer, Sklave oder einfach nur Kannibalenfutter.\n \n    \n \n Erforsche neue Technik und baue neue Ausr\u00fcstung. Kaufe Geb\u00e4ude und baue sie zu sicheren Zufluchtsst\u00e4tten aus, falls die Lage mal brenzlig wird, oder nutze sie, um dein eigenes Unternehmen zu gr\u00fcnden. Verb\u00fcnde dich mit den verschiedenen Fraktionen der Welt oder stelle dich gegen sie, w\u00e4hrend du in der unerbittlichen W\u00fcste ums \u00dcberleben k\u00e4mpfst. Trainiere deine Truppe von Schw\u00e4chlingen und mache sie zu m\u00e4chtigen Kriegern. Schultere deine verwundeten Truppenmitglieder und bring sie lebend nach Hause. FEATURES \n       \n  V\u00f6llig freies Spielen in einer zusammenh\u00e4ngenden Spielwelt.  Kenshi bietet dir die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Spielwelt in einem Singleplayer-Rollenspiel seit Daggerfall mit einer Fl\u00e4che von \u00fcber 870 Quadratkilometern. Das Spiel versucht nicht, deinen pers\u00f6nlichen Spielstil einzuschr\u00e4nken, sondern l\u00e4sst dich spielen, wie du willst.\n \n       \n  Erstelle und gestalte so viele eigene Charaktere, wie du m\u00f6chtest  und befehlige eine ganze Truppe. Je mehr Erfahrung deine Charaktere sammeln, desto st\u00e4rker und besser werden sie. Das schl\u00e4gt sich nicht nur in ihren Werten, sondern auch in ihrem optischen Erscheinungsbild nieder.\n \n       \n  Baue deine eigene Basis,  wo du neue Techniken erforschen, neue Ausr\u00fcstung herstellen und dich gegen Feinde verbarrikadieren kannst.\n \n    \n  Eine einzigartige Mischung aus Rollenspiel und Echtzeitstrategie.  Hier steuerst du keine \u00fcberm\u00e4chtigen \"Helden\" mit k\u00fcnstlich aufgeblasenen Charakterwerten. Jeder andere Charakter und jeder NPC, auf den du triffst, ist dir potenziell ebenb\u00fcrtig und hat einen Namen und ein eigenes Leben.\n \n    \n  Du bist nicht der Auserw\u00e4hlte.  Du bist nicht gro\u00df und m\u00e4chtig. Du hast nicht mehr 'Lebenspunkte' als alle anderen. Da Universum dreht sich nicht um dich, du bist nichts Besonderes. Es sei denn, du erarbeitest es dir.\n \n    \n  Kaufe Geb\u00e4ude  und baue sie zu sicheren Zufluchtsst\u00e4tten aus, falls die Lage mal brenzlig wird, oder nutze sie, um dein eigenes Unternehmen zu gr\u00fcnden.\n \n    \n  Ein Spiel mit unendlichen M\u00f6glichkeiten.  Sei gut, sei b\u00f6se, sei ein Unternehmer, ein Dieb oder einfach Einwohner einer Stadt. Lebe in der W\u00fcste, reise allein oder bring eine ganze Horde mit, baue eine Festung oder lege eine Stadt in Schutt und Asche. Verschreibe dich der Befreiung von Sklaven oder werde selbst versklavt.\n \n    \n  Eine dynamische Welt, die sich st\u00e4ndig ver\u00e4ndert.   Unterst\u00fctze oder bek\u00e4mpfe jeden, den du m\u00f6chtest, oder sei ein Eigenbr\u00f6tler. Was auch immer du tust, die Welt dreht sich weiter. Das hier ist nicht nur ein \"Spiel\"; du lebst und \u00fcberlebst in einer simulierten Welt.\n \n    \n  Du kannst von Kannibalen gefangen und bei lebendigem Leib gefressen werden.  Oder von Sklavenh\u00e4ndlern verkauft und gezwungen, in einer Mine zu schuften. Diese Ereignisse sind nicht geskriptet, sie sind ein dynamischer Bestandteil dieser chaotischen Welt, von einem Augenblick auf den anderen dein Leben ruinieren kann. Alles kann passieren, aber gleichzeitig k\u00f6nnen alle Schwierigkeiten k\u00f6nnen \u00fcberwunden werden, wenn du die St\u00e4rke dazu besitzt.\n \n    \n  Absolut kein Level-Scaling.  Die Welt passt sich nicht der St\u00e4rke deiner Charaktere an und L\u00e4den \u00e4ndern nicht ihr Angebot, um dir Gegenst\u00e4nde deiner Stufe anzubieten. Zu Beginn des Spiels wird fast alles und jeder st\u00e4rker sein als du, und der Kampf ums \u00dcberleben h\u00f6rt nie auf. Das Spiel h\u00e4lt dich nicht an der Hand und hilft dir nicht auf, wenn du am Boden bist.\n \n    \n  Realistisches Medizinsystem mit Auswirkungen auf das Gameplay.  Ein Charakter mit einem verletzten Bein hinkt oder kriecht auf dem Boden und erschwert damit das Vorankommen der Truppe. Charaktere mit verletzten Armen k\u00f6nnen Schwerter nur mit einer Hand oder eventuell gar nicht verwenden. Sehr schwere Verletzungen k\u00f6nnen auch Amputationen von Gliedma\u00dfen nach sich ziehen, die anschlie\u00dfend durch Roboter-Prothesen ersetzt werden k\u00f6nnen. Durch Blutverlust k\u00f6nnen Charaktere bewusstlos werden. Au\u00dferdem lockt das Blut Raubtiere an. Die Werte eines Charakters k\u00f6nnen durch Ausr\u00fcstung, Traglast, Blutverlust, Verletzungen und Hunger beeinflusst werden.\n \n    \n  Eine kluge KI , dank der Charaktere logisch handeln und auf langfristige Ziele und W\u00fcnsche hinarbeiten k\u00f6nnen. Gruppen arbeiten zusammen und bringen ihre Verwundeten in Sicherheit. Du kannst deinen Charakteren Aufgaben zuteilen, um das Micromanagement zu reduzieren und beispielsweise die Produktion von Gegenst\u00e4nden in deiner Basis zu automatisieren.\n \n    \n  Verb\u00fcnde dich mit den verschiedenen Fraktionen der Welt oder stelle dich gegen sie , w\u00e4hrend du in einer lebensfeindlichen Umgebung ums \u00dcberleben k\u00e4mpfst.\n \n    \n  Unabh\u00e4ngig entwickelt  ohne jegliche Designeinfl\u00fcsse von M\u00e4nnern in grauen Anz\u00fcgen, die noch nie in ihrem Leben ein Spiel gespielt haben.\n \n    \n  Eine einzigartige Spielwelt  ohne abgedroschene Fantasy-Klischees.

        "description": " Join the community   Join our community on Discord and meet other cultivators like you! You\u2019ll find many users willing to help you become the most powerful grandmaster. Come with us today and find out for yourself!\n \n \n  About the Game    \n In a world of myth and magic, those who aspire to immortality devote their lives to the sacred path of cultivation. They gather around sects, institutions which train their bodies, minds and souls to be worth eternal life. But in return for such great power, you must be willing to guard the balance between good and evil -- no matter the cost.\n \n Unfortunately, greed is inherent to human nature, so it also blinds cultivators. Your master didn\u2019t realize until it was too late, and the Taiyi Sect burnt to the ground for his mistake. Your brothers and sisters will never come back, but the Taiyi Sect can still be reborn from its ashes. Its seeds are scattered around Tiancang, waiting for you to find them. This is what your grandmaster would have wanted. You must do it for him \u2500 and for all those we sworn to protect.\n \n Set in the fictional Tiancang era, Amazing Cultivation Simulator brings to you the magic of Asian mythology through a strategy game with strong xianxia nuances, a Chinese literary genre which is deeply influenced by Taoist and Buddhist concepts, as well as folklore and traditional knowledge on medicine and martial arts. Its gameplay is inspired by famous games like Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress, as well as The Legend of Shushan Swordsman and Martial Kingdoms.\n \n As a grandmaster, you\u2019ll bring the Taiyi Sect back to its glory days by training new apprentices, gathering knowledge and expand your domain through commerce and political alliances to gain influence over other sects. Also, you must protect people from supernatural dangers such as bad spirits, monsters and enchanted artifacts. KEY FEATURES    Design your own Cultivation sect \u00a0from scratch until it becomes a huge spiritual center.\n    Manage your school and students \u00a0so they are happy and productive for you.\n    Expand your domain s\u00a0and meet new allies to become more powerful than other sects.\n    Commerce and interact with other NPCs ,\u00a0but be careful \u2013 your actions will impact their behavior!\n    Keep the balance \u00a0between good and evil.\n    Research and fill your library \u00a0with more and more sources of mystic knowledge, martial arts, medicine\u2026\n    Search for the most powerful relics \u00a0and artifacts.\n    Hunt evil beasts and demons \u00a0that want to destroy the world you want to protect.\n   Live\u00a0 unique playthroughs every time :\u00a0maps are randomly generated for each run.\n   Learn about\u00a0 Chinese myths and legends ,\u00a0as well as spiritual traditions which draw from Taoism and Buddhism.   Update \n \n    \n   Yaoguai Awakening: As Qi energies resurge across the lands, the Yaoguai finally return to the mortal realm. Enlightened beasts start cultivation of their own, craving a longer life, but they still can't escape the Creed of Heaven or the Heavenly Tribulation.\n   Taoist Animism: Even the most base of existences have the chance to attain spirituality as they subsist throughout the mists of time. If fortunate enough, some might even be enlightened by a master and turned into sentient spirits.

A hardcore RPG skillset, a vast map, a massively customisable sandbox and a cute tutorial raccoon await the unwary. So how will you die?\n\nThe Knox Event is used to refer to the zombie outbreak that occurs prior to and throughout the game. The event first takes place around Muldraugh and West Point, Kentucky. The incident is considered to have begun on the 4th of July, 1993, American Day of Independence. Just two days later the military evacuated residences from around the affected area and set up blockades in what is now known as the Knox Evacuation. The affected area is given the name: the Exclusion Zone, with the primary camp being south of Louisville.",

Your job as immigration inspector is to control the flow of people entering the Arstotzkan side of Grestin from Kolechia. Among the throngs of immigrants and visitors looking for work are hidden smugglers, spies, and terrorists. Using only the documents provided by travelers and the Ministry of Admission's primitive inspect, search, and fingerprint systems you must decide who can enter Arstotzka and who will be turned away or arrested.\n\nThe gameplay of Papers, Please focuses on the work life of an immigration inspector at a border checkpoint for the fictitious Eastern Bloc country of Arstotzka. The player inspects would-be immigrants' documents and uses a sparse array of tools to determine whether the papers are in order for the purpose of keeping spies, smugglers and other unwanted individuals out of the country. At the end of each in-game day, the player earns money based on how many immigrants they processed less any penalties for mistakes, and then must decide on a simple budget to spend that money on rent, food, heat, and other necessities in low-class housing for themselves and their family. As relations between Arstotzka and nearby countries deteriorate due to multiple terrorist attacks, each day introduces a new set of rules for immigration based on the game's story, such as denying citizens of specific countries or demanding more exacting identification from citizens. The player may be challenged with moral dilemmas and social engineering as the game progresses; such as allowing the supposed spouse of one immigrant through despite them lacking complete papers, even though they may be planning to attack your fellow guards.\nA mysterious anti-government organisation also appears, with several of its members appearing in the checkpoint, giving the inspector orders on what to do in order to help the organisation bring down the government and establish a new one; the player can choose whether or not to help this organisation.\nThe game has a scripted story mode with multiple possible endings depending on the player's previous actions, as well as an unlockable, randomized endless-play mode.\nPapers, Please has been praised by the sense of immersion provided by the game mechanics, and the intense emotional reaction.[12] CBC News' Jonathan Ore called Papers, Please a \"nerve-racking sleuthing game with relentless pacing and dozens of compelling characters - all from a desk job\"",

Ushering in a new era for the franchise with cutting-edge technology powered by the Fox Engine, MGSV: The Phantom Pain will provide players a first-rate gaming experience as they are offered tactical freedom to carry out open-world missions.\n \n\n \nNine years after the events of MGSV: GROUND ZEROES and the fall of Mother Base, Snake a.k.a.

        "brief": "Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and a prequel to the original Metal Gear. The game has a complex story with long cut-scene sequences, but there are fewer and they are shorter compared to earlier Metal Gear Solid titles. Most of the gameplay mechanics introduced in Ground Zeroes are carried over: it is still an action game and stealth oriented but replaces the linear corridor design from most earlier titles with large open world environments that offer the player unrestricted freedom for the approach. The world has now a real-time day and night cycle and various weather effects that influence enemy behaviour, visibility and sound. Sabotaging or destroying certain structures can also influence other parts of the map.\n\nThe Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has brought a new edge to the Cold War, and in 1984, a one-eyed man with a prosthetic arm appears in the country. Those who know him call him Snake; the legendary mercenary who was once swept from the stage of history and left in a coma by American private intelligence network Cipher. Snake is accompanied by Ocelot, an old friend who saved him from attack when he finally awoke.\n\nNow, Snake\u2019s former partner Kazuhira Miller is being held by the Soviet forces in Afghanistan.\n\nSnake must undertake a solo mission to rescue Miller and prove to the world that the legendary mercenary is not dead and gone.\nThat first step will lead to a path of vengeance against the very Cipher that slaughtered so many of Snake\u2019s men, and to a battle that will embroil the whole world...\n\nWhat started in Ground Zeroes... must finish with \"V.\"",

        "description": "Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Released in 2009, it follows Batman as he battles the Joker, who seizes control of Arkham Asylum and frees its inmates. The game features stealth, combat, and detective elements, with players using Batman's gadgets and skills to subdue enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nSet in a dark, immersive version of Gotham, the story explores Batman\u2019s psychological battle with his foes, including Harley Quinn, Bane, and Scarecrow. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay, atmosphere, and storytelling, becoming a defining title in superhero video games.\n\nAfter the Joker assaults Gotham City Hall, he is caught by Batman and taken to Arkham Asylum, which temporarily houses many members of the Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at Blackgate Prison. Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.\n\nThere, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan\u2014a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength\u2014intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.\n\nAt the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.\n\nBatman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Joker\u2014who is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it.",

            "text": "Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Released in 2009, it follows Batman as he battles the Joker, who seizes control of Arkham Asylum and frees its inmates. The game features stealth, combat, and detective elements, with players using Batman's gadgets and skills to subdue enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nSet in a dark, immersive version of Gotham, the story explores Batman\u2019s psychological battle with his foes, including Harley Quinn, Bane, and Scarecrow. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay, atmosphere, and storytelling, becoming a defining title in superhero video games.\n\nAfter the Joker assaults Gotham City Hall, he is caught by Batman and taken to Arkham Asylum, which temporarily houses many members of the Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at Blackgate Prison. Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.\n\nThere, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan\u2014a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength\u2014intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.\n\nAt the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.\n\nBatman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Joker\u2014who is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it."

        "brief": "Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Released in 2009, it follows Batman as he battles the Joker, who seizes control of Arkham Asylum and frees its inmates. The game features stealth, combat, and detective elements, with players using Batman's gadgets and skills to subdue enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nSet in a dark, immersive version of Gotham, the story explores Batman\u2019s psychological battle with his foes, including Harley Quinn, Bane, and Scarecrow. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay, atmosphere, and storytelling, becoming a defining title in superhero video games.\n\nAfter the Joker assaults Gotham City Hall, he is caught by Batman and taken to Arkham Asylum, which temporarily houses many members of the Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at Blackgate Prison. Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.\n\nThere, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan\u2014a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength\u2014intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.\n\nAt the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.\n\nBatman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Joker\u2014who is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it.",

Like its predecessor, the game is a primarily story-driven shooter with heavy stealth elements. Artyom may carry up to three weapons at a time, however bullets are scarce and valuable to the point that higher grade bullets are, in fact, the Metro's currency. When dealing with armed opponents, stealth is encouraged and it is wise to save ammunition for the many mutant creatures encountered in combat. In many situations the player can choose between straightforward shooting and stealth, also having the option for lethal or non-lethal enemy takedowns.\n\nThe game picks up after the bad ending from Metro 2033, in which Artyom delivers a devastating attack on the mysterious supernatural race known as the Dark Ones. The station-cities of the Metro struggle for power using weapons found in D6. The player follows Artyom, the main protagonist from Metro 2033, as he searches for the mysterious \"Prisoner\", the supposed \u201ckey to survival \u2013 the last light in our darkest hour\u2026\u201d",

Like its predecessor, the game is a primarily story-driven shooter with heavy stealth elements. Artyom may carry up to three weapons at a time, however bullets are scarce and valuable to the point that higher grade bullets are, in fact, the Metro's currency. When dealing with armed opponents, stealth is encouraged and it is wise to save ammunition for the many mutant creatures encountered in combat. In many situations the player can choose between straightforward shooting and stealth, also having the option for lethal or non-lethal enemy takedowns.\n\nThe game picks up after the bad ending from Metro 2033, in which Artyom delivers a devastating attack on the mysterious supernatural race known as the Dark Ones. The station-cities of the Metro struggle for power using weapons found in D6. The player follows Artyom, the main protagonist from Metro 2033, as he searches for the mysterious \"Prisoner\", the supposed \u201ckey to survival \u2013 the last light in our darkest hour\u2026\u201d"

Like its predecessor, the game is a primarily story-driven shooter with heavy stealth elements. Artyom may carry up to three weapons at a time, however bullets are scarce and valuable to the point that higher grade bullets are, in fact, the Metro's currency. When dealing with armed opponents, stealth is encouraged and it is wise to save ammunition for the many mutant creatures encountered in combat. In many situations the player can choose between straightforward shooting and stealth, also having the option for lethal or non-lethal enemy takedowns.\n\nThe game picks up after the bad ending from Metro 2033, in which Artyom delivers a devastating attack on the mysterious supernatural race known as the Dark Ones. The station-cities of the Metro struggle for power using weapons found in D6. The player follows Artyom, the main protagonist from Metro 2033, as he searches for the mysterious \"Prisoner\", the supposed \u201ckey to survival \u2013 the last light in our darkest hour\u2026\u201d",

        "description": "As Lara Croft races to save the world from a Maya apocalypse, she must become the Tomb Raider she is destined to be.\n\nIn the two months since Rise of the Tomb Raider, Lara Croft and her friend Jonah Maiava have dedicated themselves to stopping the activities of paramilitary organization Trinity. The two track a cell to Cozumel in Mexico that is led by Pedro Dominguez, the head of Trinity's High Council. Slipping inside nearby tombs being excavated by Trinity, Lara discovers a temple containing the Dagger of Chak Chel and references to a hidden city. Murals adorning the walls allude to the Silver Box of Ix Chel and warn of \"the Cleansing\", a Mayan apocalypse culminating in a permanent solar eclipse. Lara ignores the warnings and takes the Dagger to prevent Trinity from acquiring it. Dominguez catches her and reveals that by taking the Dagger, Lara has triggered the Cleansing. He takes the Dagger, intending to unite it with the Box to stop the Cleansing and use the power it grants him to remake the world in his image. Lara and Jonah escape a tsunami that destroys Cozumel and foreshadows the coming apocalypse.\nDespite growing tensions between them over her actions, Lara and Jonah pursue Dominguez into the Amazon. Their plane crashes in the Peruvian jungle during the second cataclysm\u2014a massive storm\u2014and the two find their way to Paititi, the hidden city shown in the murals. Exploring local tombs reveals that piercing the Box with the Dagger will grant the user the power of the god Kukulkan, which must be used to halt the Cleansing. Lara witnesses Trinity soldiers being slaughtered by strange humanoid monsters later identified as the Yaaxil, guardians of the Box. When Lara saves a boy named Etzli, she and Jonah are brought into Paititi by his mother Unuratu, queen of the city. Lara sees Dominguez is the leader of a cult dedicated to Kukulkan and Unuratu reveals he is her brother-in-law Amaru, who was taken by Trinity as a child and raised to complete the ritual and reshape the world in their image. Unuratu directs Lara to the Box, but Lara finds it is missing. Believing the cult already has the Box, Lara, and Unuratu attempt to steal it, but Unuratu is captured. Lara also encounters the Yaaxil and their leader Crimson Fire.\nLara infiltrates the cult's temple and overhears Amaru telling Unuratu that the Box was hidden by Andres Lopez, a missionary sent to Paititi by Trinity during the Spanish conquest of South America. Lara rescues Unuratu and realizes that Amaru does not fully understand the ritual; rather than merely imbuing Kukulkan's power, the ritual sacrifices it to stop the Cleansing. Unuratu is shot by Commander Rourke, Amaru's second in command. Before she dies, Unuratu implores Lara to complete the ritual but warns her not to let the Box influence her. Rourke attacks Lara and Jonah, who are separated as they leave Paititi to decipher the next clue. Thinking Jonah dead, Lara goes on a rampage that destroys an oil refinery and slaughters everyone there except Rourke, who escapes. She momentarily breaks down when she finds Jonah alive, but he manages to calm her, and they decipher the Box's location. Driven mad by the Box, Lopez established a mission near Paititi where he trained acolytes to complete the ritual. Lara and Jonah find a secret catacomb beneath the missiong leading to Lopez's tomb and the Box. Amaru finds them and forces Lara to surrender the Box. He admits that he ordered her father's death to prevent him from finding Paititi and revealing it to the world. Lara tries to persuade Amaru to use the ritual to benefit the world. He refuses, as the Cleansing will only affect Paititi. Amaru has used his position in Trinity to manipulate them into preventing it. He leaves Lara and Jonah to escape the third cataclysm, a massive earthquake that causes a landslide and destroys the mission.\nBack in Paititi, Lara and Jonah help the newly-crowned Etzli lead an assault on an underground temple complex at Paititi's center. They plan to disrupt Amaru's ceremony while avoiding the fourth cataclysm, a volcanic eruption threatening Paititi. Lara is forced to go on alone when Trinity cuts off Etzli's forces. She encounters the Yaaxil and Crimson Fire, convincing them to help her stop Amaru. Lara takes on the symbolic role of Ix Chel while Crimson Fire becomes Chak Chel. While the Yaaxil kill Rourke and the Trinity High Council, Lara makes it to the temple summit. She fails to stop Amaru from piercing the Box and absorbing Kukulkan's power as an eclipse blocks the sun. Lara overpowers Amaru after a lengthy battle; accepting defeat, he transfers Kukulkan's power to Lara as he dies. True to Unuratu's warning, she is tempted to use the Box to revive her parents, but instead lets Crimson Fire symbolically stab her, sacrificing Kukulkan's spirit and stopping the Cleansing. In the aftermath, Unuratu is laid to rest, and Jonah decides to take a vacation. Lara stays in Paititi to help Etzli restore the city to its former glory. A post-credits scene shows Lara planning her next adventure at Croft Manor, acknowledging that her role is not to solve the world's mysteries, but to protect them.",

            "text": "As Lara Croft races to save the world from a Maya apocalypse, she must become the Tomb Raider she is destined to be.\n\nIn the two months since Rise of the Tomb Raider, Lara Croft and her friend Jonah Maiava have dedicated themselves to stopping the activities of paramilitary organization Trinity. The two track a cell to Cozumel in Mexico that is led by Pedro Dominguez, the head of Trinity's High Council. Slipping inside nearby tombs being excavated by Trinity, Lara discovers a temple containing the Dagger of Chak Chel and references to a hidden city. Murals adorning the walls allude to the Silver Box of Ix Chel and warn of \"the Cleansing\", a Mayan apocalypse culminating in a permanent solar eclipse. Lara ignores the warnings and takes the Dagger to prevent Trinity from acquiring it. Dominguez catches her and reveals that by taking the Dagger, Lara has triggered the Cleansing. He takes the Dagger, intending to unite it with the Box to stop the Cleansing and use the power it grants him to remake the world in his image. Lara and Jonah escape a tsunami that destroys Cozumel and foreshadows the coming apocalypse.\nDespite growing tensions between them over her actions, Lara and Jonah pursue Dominguez into the Amazon. Their plane crashes in the Peruvian jungle during the second cataclysm\u2014a massive storm\u2014and the two find their way to Paititi, the hidden city shown in the murals. Exploring local tombs reveals that piercing the Box with the Dagger will grant the user the power of the god Kukulkan, which must be used to halt the Cleansing. Lara witnesses Trinity soldiers being slaughtered by strange humanoid monsters later identified as the Yaaxil, guardians of the Box. When Lara saves a boy named Etzli, she and Jonah are brought into Paititi by his mother Unuratu, queen of the city. Lara sees Dominguez is the leader of a cult dedicated to Kukulkan and Unuratu reveals he is her brother-in-law Amaru, who was taken by Trinity as a child and raised to complete the ritual and reshape the world in their image. Unuratu directs Lara to the Box, but Lara finds it is missing. Believing the cult already has the Box, Lara, and Unuratu attempt to steal it, but Unuratu is captured. Lara also encounters the Yaaxil and their leader Crimson Fire.\nLara infiltrates the cult's temple and overhears Amaru telling Unuratu that the Box was hidden by Andres Lopez, a missionary sent to Paititi by Trinity during the Spanish conquest of South America. Lara rescues Unuratu and realizes that Amaru does not fully understand the ritual; rather than merely imbuing Kukulkan's power, the ritual sacrifices it to stop the Cleansing. Unuratu is shot by Commander Rourke, Amaru's second in command. Before she dies, Unuratu implores Lara to complete the ritual but warns her not to let the Box influence her. Rourke attacks Lara and Jonah, who are separated as they leave Paititi to decipher the next clue. Thinking Jonah dead, Lara goes on a rampage that destroys an oil refinery and slaughters everyone there except Rourke, who escapes. She momentarily breaks down when she finds Jonah alive, but he manages to calm her, and they decipher the Box's location. Driven mad by the Box, Lopez established a mission near Paititi where he trained acolytes to complete the ritual. Lara and Jonah find a secret catacomb beneath the missiong leading to Lopez's tomb and the Box. Amaru finds them and forces Lara to surrender the Box. He admits that he ordered her father's death to prevent him from finding Paititi and revealing it to the world. Lara tries to persuade Amaru to use the ritual to benefit the world. He refuses, as the Cleansing will only affect Paititi. Amaru has used his position in Trinity to manipulate them into preventing it. He leaves Lara and Jonah to escape the third cataclysm, a massive earthquake that causes a landslide and destroys the mission.\nBack in Paititi, Lara and Jonah help the newly-crowned Etzli lead an assault on an underground temple complex at Paititi's center. They plan to disrupt Amaru's ceremony while avoiding the fourth cataclysm, a volcanic eruption threatening Paititi. Lara is forced to go on alone when Trinity cuts off Etzli's forces. She encounters the Yaaxil and Crimson Fire, convincing them to help her stop Amaru. Lara takes on the symbolic role of Ix Chel while Crimson Fire becomes Chak Chel. While the Yaaxil kill Rourke and the Trinity High Council, Lara makes it to the temple summit. She fails to stop Amaru from piercing the Box and absorbing Kukulkan's power as an eclipse blocks the sun. Lara overpowers Amaru after a lengthy battle; accepting defeat, he transfers Kukulkan's power to Lara as he dies. True to Unuratu's warning, she is tempted to use the Box to revive her parents, but instead lets Crimson Fire symbolically stab her, sacrificing Kukulkan's spirit and stopping the Cleansing. In the aftermath, Unuratu is laid to rest, and Jonah decides to take a vacation. Lara stays in Paititi to help Etzli restore the city to its former glory. A post-credits scene shows Lara planning her next adventure at Croft Manor, acknowledging that her role is not to solve the world's mysteries, but to protect them."

Lara witnesses Trinity soldiers being slaughtered by strange humanoid monsters later identified as the Yaaxil, guardians of the Box. When Lara saves a boy named Etzli, she and Jonah are brought into Paititi by his mother Unuratu, queen of the city. Lara sees Dominguez is the leader of a cult dedicated to Kukulkan and Unuratu reveals he is her brother-in-law Amaru, who was taken by Trinity as a child and raised to complete the ritual and reshape the world in their image. Unuratu directs Lara to the Box, but Lara finds it is missing. Believing the cult already has the Box, Lara, and Unuratu attempt to steal it, but Unuratu is captured. Lara also encounters the Yaaxil and their leader Crimson Fire.\nLara infiltrates the cult's temple and overhears Amaru telling Unuratu that the Box was hidden by Andres Lopez, a missionary sent to Paititi by Trinity during the Spanish conquest of South America. Lara rescues Unuratu and realizes that Amaru does not fully understand the ritual; rather than merely imbuing Kukulkan's power, the ritual sacrifices it to stop the Cleansing. Unuratu is shot by Commander Rourke, Amaru's second in command. Before she dies, Unuratu implores Lara to complete the ritual but warns her not to let the Box influence her. Rourke attacks Lara and Jonah, who are separated as they leave Paititi to decipher the next clue. Thinking Jonah dead, Lara goes on a rampage that destroys an oil refinery and slaughters everyone there except Rourke, who escapes. She momentarily breaks down when she finds Jonah alive, but he manages to calm her, and they decipher the Box's location. Driven mad by the Box, Lopez established a mission near Paititi where he trained acolytes to complete the ritual. Lara and Jonah find a secret catacomb beneath the missiong leading to Lopez's tomb and the Box. Amaru finds them and forces Lara to surrender the Box. He admits that he ordered her father's death to prevent him from finding Paititi and revealing it to the world. Lara tries to persuade Amaru to use the ritual to benefit the world. He refuses, as the Cleansing will only affect Paititi. Amaru has used his position in Trinity to manipulate them into preventing it. He leaves Lara and Jonah to escape the third cataclysm, a massive earthquake that causes a landslide and destroys the mission.\nBack in Paititi, Lara and Jonah help the newly-crowned Etzli lead an assault on an underground temple complex at Paititi's center. They plan to disrupt Amaru's ceremony while avoiding the fourth cataclysm, a volcanic eruption threatening Paititi. Lara is forced to go on alone when Trinity cuts off Etzli's forces. She encounters the Yaaxil and Crimson Fire, convincing them to help her stop Amaru. Lara takes on the symbolic role of Ix Chel while Crimson Fire becomes Chak Chel. While the Yaaxil kill Rourke and the Trinity High Council, Lara makes it to the temple summit. She fails to stop Amaru from piercing the Box and absorbing Kukulkan's power as an eclipse blocks the sun. Lara overpowers Amaru after a lengthy battle; accepting defeat, he transfers Kukulkan's power to Lara as he dies. True to Unuratu's warning, she is tempted to use the Box to revive her parents, but instead lets Crimson Fire symbolically stab her, sacrificing Kukulkan's spirit and stopping the Cleansing. In the aftermath, Unuratu is laid to rest, and Jonah decides to take a vacation. Lara stays in Paititi to help Etzli restore the city to its former glory. A post-credits scene shows Lara planning her next adventure at Croft Manor, acknowledging that her role is not to solve the world's mysteries, but to protect them.",

It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\nTwo expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.\n\nGrand Theft Auto IV follows the story of Niko Bellic, a veteran of an unnamed war in Eastern Europe, who is haunted by the betrayal of his 15 man army unit. Ten years later, after a smuggling run goes bad due to a betrayal from a partner, Niko leaves Eastern Europe to escape the anger of his employer, Ray Bulgarin. After six months in the merchant navy (serving aboard the cargo ship the Platypus), and believing the stories of his cousin Roman, Niko comes to Liberty City to pursue the American Dream as well as searching for the traitor of his unit. After his arrival, however, Niko quickly learns that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loansharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion.",

            "text": "Grand Theft Auto IV is an action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\nTwo expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.\n\nGrand Theft Auto IV follows the story of Niko Bellic, a veteran of an unnamed war in Eastern Europe, who is haunted by the betrayal of his 15 man army unit. Ten years later, after a smuggling run goes bad due to a betrayal from a partner, Niko leaves Eastern Europe to escape the anger of his employer, Ray Bulgarin. After six months in the merchant navy (serving aboard the cargo ship the Platypus), and believing the stories of his cousin Roman, Niko comes to Liberty City to pursue the American Dream as well as searching for the traitor of his unit. After his arrival, however, Niko quickly learns that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loansharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion."

        "brief": "Grand Theft Auto IV is an action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\nTwo expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.\n\nGrand Theft Auto IV follows the story of Niko Bellic, a veteran of an unnamed war in Eastern Europe, who is haunted by the betrayal of his 15 man army unit. Ten years later, after a smuggling run goes bad due to a betrayal from a partner, Niko leaves Eastern Europe to escape the anger of his employer, Ray Bulgarin. After six months in the merchant navy (serving aboard the cargo ship the Platypus), and believing the stories of his cousin Roman, Niko comes to Liberty City to pursue the American Dream as well as searching for the traitor of his unit. After his arrival, however, Niko quickly learns that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loansharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion.",

Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but  thriving...  \n \n  Just make sure you don't forget to breathe.   \n Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live.  \n It\u2019s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost.  \n Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists.  \n Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine.  \n Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly.  \n Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis.  \n Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you\u2019re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts.  \n Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds: Summon new worlds with a push of a button. Experience tons of untamed space rocks, then suffocate to death in them!\n  ",

Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live.  \n It\u2019s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost.  \n Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists.  \n Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine.  \n Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly.  \n Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis.  \n Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you\u2019re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts.  \n Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds: Summon new worlds with a push of a button.

Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost.  \n Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists.  \n Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine.  \n Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly.  \n Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis.  \n Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you\u2019re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts.  \n Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds: Summon new worlds with a push of a button.

The Game builds upon cooperatively focused gameplay and Valve's proprietary Source engine, the same game engine used in the original Left 4 Dead. Set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, Left 4 Dead 2 focuses on four new Survivors, fighting against hordes of the Infected, who develop severe psychosis and exhibit zombie-like tendencies. The Survivors must fight their way through five campaigns, interspersed with safe houses that act as checkpoints, with the goal of escape at each campaign's finale.",

Gameplay is inspired by point-and-click adventure games (like the classic Monkey Island or King's Quest series, or more recently Telltale's Walking Dead series), but focused on characterization, atmosphere and storytelling rather than clever puzzles or challenges of skill.\n\nThe game is developed by Cardboard Computer (Jake Elliott, Tamas Kemenczy, and Ben Babbitt), and features an original electronic score by Ben Babbitt along with a suite of old hymns \u0026 bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers.",

Prokosch ist an Camille sehr interessiert und l\u00e4sst nichts unversucht, um sie nach Hause zu fahren. Ihr Mann Paul hat nichts dagegen, im Gegenteil: Er besteht darauf, dass Camille Prokoschs Angebot annimmt. Camille ist \u00fcberzeugt, dass Paul nur seine Karriere im Kopf hat und sie deshalb mit Prokosch verkuppeln will. Sie schreibt an Paul einen Brief, in dem sie ihre Verachtung f\u00fcr sein Handeln unmissverst\u00e4ndlich darlegt. Doch zu einer Aussprache soll es nicht mehr kommen."

Sono passati circa sessanta anni da quando lavorava come capo delle guardie del braccio della morte nel penitenziario di Could Mountain. Durante la grande depressione, nel carcere del sud degli Usa, Edgecomb si occupava di quattro assassini che attendevano di compiere la loro ultima passeggiata lungo il 'Miglio verde', il corridoio rivestito di linoleum verde che li avrebbe condotti nella stanza della sedia elettrica. Fra questi c'era anche John Coffrey, un ragazzone nero condannato per l'omicidio di due gemelline di nove anni. Nonostante avesse le dimensioni e la forza per uccidere chiunque, Coffrey aveva un carattere semplice e ingenuo: era davvero lui il colpevole?"

The only one capable of putting a stop to him is the wizard he once called his closest friend, Albus Dumbledore. However, Dumbledore will need to seek help from the wizard who had thwarted Grindelwald once before, his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.",

Sono passati pochi mesi dalla cattura da parte del MACUSA del perfido e potente Grindelwald e, come da minaccia, il Mago Oscuro sfugge presto alla detenzione, nel corso di una sequenza aerea che stabilisce da subito le caratteristiche dello spettacolo visivo che sta per seguire: vertiginoso, inquieto e acrobatico. Grindelwald ha piani estremi, sul mondo dei maghi e su quello dei non maghi, e si dirige a radunare i suoi seguaci, pescando tra le fila degli scontenti per i metodi repressivi e violenti del Ministero della Magia. Ma in particolare cerca Credence, l'Obscuriale miracolosamente scampato alla morte. Anche Newt Scamander, il timido magizoologo, \u00e8 sulle tracce del ragazzo, per conto di Albus Silente. E naturalmente anche il Ministero, e l'Auror Tina, con la quale Newt ha un malinteso sentimentale in sospeso."

Produzent Christof entwarf eine k\u00fcnstliche Welt, genannt Seahaven, in der Truman von \u00fcber 5000 Kameras 24 Stunden am Tag bei fast jeder Kleinigkeit beobachtet wird.

It was released on November 6, 1992, by Epic Records, four days after the release of the album's first single, \"Killing in the Name\". The album was based largely on the band's first commercial demo tape of the same name, completed 11 months prior to the album's release. The tape contained earlier recordings of seven of the ten songs.\n\nWith politically themed, revolutionary lyrical content, the album artwork was notable for its graphic photograph of Vietnamese monk Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c performing self-immolation in June 1963.

A classically trained pianist, Keys wrote, arranged and produced the majority of the album herself, though she frequently worked with her then-partner Kerry \"Krucial\" Brothers. The efforts resulted in a neo soul record fusing contemporary classical music with R\u0026B, soul, and jazz, alongside influences of hip-hop, blues, and gospel. Its lyrics focus on themes of love, perseverance, self-worth, survival, and introspection. Despite the album's title, only two of its tracks are composed in the key of A minor. ",

        "description": "Born This Way is the second studio album and third major release by American recording artist Lady Gaga. It was released on May 23, 2011 by Interscope Records as a follow up to her internationally successful, The Fame (2008) and the extended play The Fame Monster (2009). Born This Way is notably different from The Fame and The Fame Monster as it incorporates a broader range of elements of several musical genres such as opera, heavy metal, disco, and rock and roll, and fuses those elements with sounds of electropop and dance. The album also is heavily inspired by synthpop and electronic music from the 1980s and 90s. In the album, the central themes include those of religion, sexuality, and feminism. On the record, Gaga worked with several producers, including RedOne, the only hold over for her previous work. With Born This Way, Gaga took more control of her musical direction and the album composition.\nProduction first took place in early 2010, with recording sessions for the album took place at various recording studios around the world. The title was revealed in September at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards after Gaga's win of the Video of the Year Award for \"Bad Romance\". Just a week before the album's scheduled release, the contents were leaked online, but were shortly removed due to copyright violations.\nThree singles and one promotional single were released for the album. \"Born This Way\", the lead single, topped the charts in over eighteen countries including the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. It would become the fastest selling single in iTunes history, having sold over 1 million copies within its first five days. \"Judas\" was the second single for Born This Way. The song peaked on the top ten in nineteen countries. \"The Edge of Glory\", originally released as one of two proposed promotional singles, was shortly made as the third single of the album. The song debuted at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, and topped the charts in Brazil and South Korea. The promotional single for the album, \"Hair\", peaked at number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100 and chart on the musical charts in sixteen different countries.\nThe album has been met with generally positive reception from contemporary critics, who complimented Gaga's vocals and the album's varying musical styles. However, the repetitive use of the word \"Jesus\", in addition to the employment of church bells and monk voices in many of the album's tracks including \"Marry the Night,\" \"Bloody Mary\" and \"Electric Chapel\" have all resulted in negative reactions from some Christian societies, including those in Lebanon, where Born This Way was temporarily banned. Despite such strife, Born This Way topped the charts in twenty-three countries. It debuted atop the US Billboard 200 chart with first-week sales of 1.11 million copies. Over 430,000 of these sales were at a special price of US$ 0.99, which Amazon.com offered for two days during the album's first week of release.",

        "description": "The Downward Spiral is the second studio album by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released on March 8, 1994, by Nothing Records in the United States and Island Records in Europe. It is a concept album detailing the self-destruction of a man from the beginning of his misanthropic \"downward spiral\" to his suicidal breaking point. The album was a commercial success and established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s music scene, with its sound being widely imitated, and the band receiving media attention and multiple honors. \n\nTrent Reznor, the band's sole official member at the time, had moved to 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, the site of the murder of actress Sharon Tate by members of the Manson Family in 1969; it was transformed into a studio for recording the Broken EP (1992) and subsequently The Downward Spiral. The album features elements of industrial rock, techno, metal and ambient soundscapes, in contrast to the band's synth-pop-influenced debut album Pretty Hate Machine (1989). Reznor was strongly influenced by David Bowie's Low and Pink Floyd's The Wall for their themes of introspection and dissociation, and their focus on texture and space. ",

The album features elements of industrial rock, techno, metal and ambient soundscapes, in contrast to the band's synth-pop-influenced debut album Pretty Hate Machine (1989). Reznor was strongly influenced by David Bowie's Low and Pink Floyd's The Wall for their themes of introspection and dissociation, and their focus on texture and space. "

In its final form it comprised an allegorical prologue and four entr\u00e9es, or acts, each set in an exotic place, the whole being unified around the theme of love. The work dates from 1735 except for the last entr\u00e9e, which was added the following year. In 1761, however, Rameau dropped the relatively short and mildly contrasted third entr\u00e9e so as to leave what is now considered the work's definitive form: Prologue; Le turc g\u00e9n\u00e9reux (The Generous Turk); Les incas du P\u00e9rou (The Incas of Peru); and Les sauvages (The Savages of North America). The dropped entr\u00e9e was Les fleurs (The Flowers of Persia). Famous pieces from Les Indes galantes include the Dance of the Peace Pipe and the Chaconne, both from The Savages of North America.[1]",

        "description": "Place: Seville, Spain, and surrounding hills\nTime: Around 1820\nAct 1\nA square, in Seville. On the right, a door to the tobacco factory. At the back, a bridge. On the left, a guardhouse.\nA group of soldiers relaxes in the square, waiting for the changing of the guard and commenting on the passers-by (\"Sur la place, chacun passe\"). Mica\u00ebla appears, seeking Jos\u00e9. Moral\u00e8s tells her that \"Jos\u00e9 is not yet on duty\" and invites her to wait with them. She declines, saying she will return later. Jos\u00e9 arrives with the new guard, who is greeted and imitated by a crowd of urchins (\"Avec la garde montante\").\nAs the factory bell rings, the cigarette girls emerge and exchange banter with young men in the crowd (\"La cloche a sonn\u00e9\"). Carmen enters and sings her provocative habanera on the untameable nature of love (\"L'amour est un oiseau rebelle\"). The men plead with her to choose a lover, and after some teasing she throws a flower to Don Jos\u00e9, who thus far has been ignoring her but is now annoyed by her insolence.\nAs the women go back to the factory, Mica\u00ebla returns and gives Jos\u00e9 a letter and a kiss from his mother (\"Parle-moi de ma m\u00e8re!\"). He reads that his mother wants him to return home and marry Mica\u00ebla, who retreats in shy embarrassment on learning this. Just as Jos\u00e9 declares that he is ready to heed his mother's wishes, the women stream from the factory in great agitation. Zuniga, the officer of the guard, learns that Carmen has attacked a woman with a knife. When challenged, Carmen answers with mocking defiance (\"Tra la la... Coupe-moi, br\u00fble-moi\"); Zuniga orders Jos\u00e9 to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant. Left alone with Jos\u00e9, Carmen beguiles him with a seguidilla, in which she sings of a night of dancing and passion with her lover\u2014whoever that may be\u2014in Lillas Pastia's tavern. Confused yet mesmerised, Jos\u00e9 agrees to free her hands; as she is led away she pushes her escort to the ground and runs off laughing. Jos\u00e9 is arrested for dereliction of duty.\nAct 2\nLillas Pastia's Inn\nTwo months have passed. Carmen and her friends Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s are entertaining Zuniga and other officers (\"Les tringles des sistres tintaient\") in Pastia's inn. Carmen is delighted to learn of Jos\u00e9's release from two months' detention. Outside, a chorus and procession announces the arrival of the toreador Escamillo (\"Vivat, vivat le Tor\u00e9ro\"). Invited inside, he introduces himself with the \"Toreador Song\" (\"Votre toast, je peux vous le rendre\") and sets his sights on Carmen, who brushes him aside. Lillas Pastia hustles the crowds and the soldiers away.\nWhen only Carmen, Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s remain, smugglers Danca\u00efre and Remendado arrive and reveal their plans to dispose of some recently acquired contraband (\"Nous avons en t\u00eate une affaire\"). Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s are keen to help them, but Carmen refuses, since she wishes to wait for Jos\u00e9. After the smugglers leave, Jos\u00e9 arrives. Carmen treats him to a private exotic dance (\"Je vais danser en votre honneur ... La la la\"), but her song is joined by a distant bugle call from the barracks. When Jos\u00e9 says he must return to duty, she mocks him, and he answers by showing her the flower that she threw to him in the square (\"La fleur que tu m'avais jet\u00e9e\"). Unconvinced, Carmen demands he show his love by leaving with her. Jos\u00e9 refuses to desert, but as he prepares to depart, Zuniga enters looking for Carmen. He and Jos\u00e9 fight, and are separated by the returning smugglers, who restrain Zuniga. Having attacked a superior officer, Jos\u00e9 now has no choice but to join Carmen and the smugglers (\"Suis-nous \u00e0 travers la campagne\").\nAct 3\nA wild spot in the mountains\nCarmen and Jos\u00e9 enter with the smugglers and their booty (\"\u00c9coute, \u00e9coute, compagnons\"); Carmen has now become bored with Jos\u00e9 and tells him scornfully that he should go back to his mother. Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s amuse themselves by reading their fortunes from the cards; Carmen joins them and finds that the cards are foretelling her death, and Jos\u00e9's. The women depart to suborn the customs officers who are watching the locality.

On the left, a guardhouse.\nA group of soldiers relaxes in the square, waiting for the changing of the guard and commenting on the passers-by (\"Sur la place, chacun passe\"). Mica\u00ebla appears, seeking Jos\u00e9. Moral\u00e8s tells her that \"Jos\u00e9 is not yet on duty\" and invites her to wait with them. She declines, saying she will return later. Jos\u00e9 arrives with the new guard, who is greeted and imitated by a crowd of urchins (\"Avec la garde montante\").\nAs the factory bell rings, the cigarette girls emerge and exchange banter with young men in the crowd (\"La cloche a sonn\u00e9\"). Carmen enters and sings her provocative habanera on the untameable nature of love (\"L'amour est un oiseau rebelle\"). The men plead with her to choose a lover, and after some teasing she throws a flower to Don Jos\u00e9, who thus far has been ignoring her but is now annoyed by her insolence.\nAs the women go back to the factory, Mica\u00ebla returns and gives Jos\u00e9 a letter and a kiss from his mother (\"Parle-moi de ma m\u00e8re!\"). He reads that his mother wants him to return home and marry Mica\u00ebla, who retreats in shy embarrassment on learning this. Just as Jos\u00e9 declares that he is ready to heed his mother's wishes, the women stream from the factory in great agitation. Zuniga, the officer of the guard, learns that Carmen has attacked a woman with a knife. When challenged, Carmen answers with mocking defiance (\"Tra la la... Coupe-moi, br\u00fble-moi\"); Zuniga orders Jos\u00e9 to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant. Left alone with Jos\u00e9, Carmen beguiles him with a seguidilla, in which she sings of a night of dancing and passion with her lover\u2014whoever that may be\u2014in Lillas Pastia's tavern. Confused yet mesmerised, Jos\u00e9 agrees to free her hands; as she is led away she pushes her escort to the ground and runs off laughing. Jos\u00e9 is arrested for dereliction of duty.\nAct 2\nLillas Pastia's Inn\nTwo months have passed. Carmen and her friends Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s are entertaining Zuniga and other officers (\"Les tringles des sistres tintaient\") in Pastia's inn. Carmen is delighted to learn of Jos\u00e9's release from two months' detention. Outside, a chorus and procession announces the arrival of the toreador Escamillo (\"Vivat, vivat le Tor\u00e9ro\"). Invited inside, he introduces himself with the \"Toreador Song\" (\"Votre toast, je peux vous le rendre\") and sets his sights on Carmen, who brushes him aside. Lillas Pastia hustles the crowds and the soldiers away.\nWhen only Carmen, Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s remain, smugglers Danca\u00efre and Remendado arrive and reveal their plans to dispose of some recently acquired contraband (\"Nous avons en t\u00eate une affaire\"). Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s are keen to help them, but Carmen refuses, since she wishes to wait for Jos\u00e9. After the smugglers leave, Jos\u00e9 arrives. Carmen treats him to a private exotic dance (\"Je vais danser en votre honneur ... La la la\"), but her song is joined by a distant bugle call from the barracks. When Jos\u00e9 says he must return to duty, she mocks him, and he answers by showing her the flower that she threw to him in the square (\"La fleur que tu m'avais jet\u00e9e\"). Unconvinced, Carmen demands he show his love by leaving with her. Jos\u00e9 refuses to desert, but as he prepares to depart, Zuniga enters looking for Carmen. He and Jos\u00e9 fight, and are separated by the returning smugglers, who restrain Zuniga. Having attacked a superior officer, Jos\u00e9 now has no choice but to join Carmen and the smugglers (\"Suis-nous \u00e0 travers la campagne\").\nAct 3\nA wild spot in the mountains\nCarmen and Jos\u00e9 enter with the smugglers and their booty (\"\u00c9coute, \u00e9coute, compagnons\"); Carmen has now become bored with Jos\u00e9 and tells him scornfully that he should go back to his mother. Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s amuse themselves by reading their fortunes from the cards; Carmen joins them and finds that the cards are foretelling her death, and Jos\u00e9's.

        "description": "The opera begins with the overture, which Mozart composed last.\nAct 1\nScene 1: A rough, rocky landscape\nTamino, a handsome prince lost in a distant land, is pursued by a serpent and asks the gods to save him (aria: \"Zu Hilfe! Zu Hilfe!\" segued into trio: \"Stirb, Ungeheuer, durch uns're Macht!\"). He faints, and three ladies, attendants of the Queen of the Night, appear and kill the serpent. They find the unconscious prince extremely attractive, and each of them tries to convince the other two to leave. After arguing, they reluctantly decide to leave together.\nTamino wakes up, and is surprised to find himself still alive. Papageno enters dressed as a bird. He describes his life as a bird-catcher, complaining he has no wife or girlfriend (aria: \"Der Vogelf\u00e4nger bin ich ja\"). Tamino introduces himself to Papageno, thinking Papageno killed the serpent. Papageno happily takes the credit \u2013 claiming he strangled it with his bare hands. The three ladies suddenly reappear and instead of giving Papageno wine, cake and figs, they give him water, a stone and place a padlock over his mouth as a warning not to lie. They give Tamino a portrait of the Queen of the Night's daughter Pamina, with whom Tamino falls instantly in love (aria: \"Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd sch\u00f6n\" / This image is enchantingly beautiful).\nThe ladies return and tell Tamino that Pamina has been captured by Sarastro, whom they describe as a powerful, evil demon. Tamino vows to rescue Pamina. The Queen of the Night appears and promises Tamino that Pamina will be his if he rescues her from Sarastro (Recitative and aria: \"O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn\" / Oh, tremble not, my dear son!). The Queen leaves and the ladies remove the padlock from Papageno's mouth with a warning not to lie any more. They give Tamino a magic flute which has the power to change sorrow into joy. They tell Papageno to go with Tamino, and give him (Papageno) magic bells for protection. The ladies introduce three child-spirits, who will guide Tamino and Papageno to Sarastro's temple. Together Tamino and Papageno set forth (Quintet: \"Hm! Hm! Hm! Hm!\").\nScene 2: A room in Sarastro's palace\nPamina is dragged in by Sarastro's slaves, apparently having tried to escape. Monostatos, a blackamoor and chief of the slaves, orders the slaves to chain her and leave him alone with her. Papageno, sent ahead by Tamino to help find Pamina, enters (Trio: \"Du feines T\u00e4ubchen, nur herein!\"). Monostatos and Papageno are each terrified by the other's strange appearance and both flee. Papageno returns and announces to Pamina that her mother has sent Tamino to save her. Pamina rejoices to hear that Tamino is in love with her. She offers sympathy and hope to Papageno, who longs for a wife. Together they reflect on the joys and sacred duties of marital love (duet: \"Bei M\u00e4nnern welche Liebe f\u00fchlen\").\nFinale. Scene 3: A grove in front of a temple\nThe three child-spirits lead Tamino to Sarastro's temple, promising that if he remains patient, wise and steadfast, he will succeed in rescuing Pamina (Quartet: \"Zum Ziele f\u00fchrt dich diese Bahn\"). Tamino approaches the left-hand entrance and is denied access by voices from within. The same happens when he goes to the entrance on the right. But from the entrance in the middle, an old priest appears and lets Tamino in. (The old priest is referred to as \"The Speaker\" in the libretto, but his role is a singing role.) He tells Tamino that Sarastro is benevolent, not evil, and that he should not trust the Queen of the Night. He promises that Tamino's confusion will be lifted when Tamino approaches the temple in a spirit of friendship. Tamino plays his magic flute. Animals appear and dance, enraptured, to his music. Tamino hears Papageno's pipes sounding offstage, and hurries off to find him (aria: \"Wie stark ist nicht dein Zauberton\").\nPapageno and Pamina enter, searching for Tamino (trio: \"Schnelle F\u00fc\u00dfe, rascher Mut\"). They are recaptured by Monostatos and his slaves. Papageno plays his magic bells, and Monostatos and his slaves begin to dance, and exit the stage, still dancing, mesmerised by the beauty of the music (chorus: \"Das klinget so herrlich\"). Papageno and Pamina hear the sound of Sarastro's retinue approaching. Papageno is frightened and asks Pamina what they should say. She answers that they must tell the truth. Sarastro enters, with a crowd of followers. (chorus: \"Es lebe Sarastro!\")\nPamina falls at Sarastro's feet and confesses that she tried to escape because Monostatos had forced his attentions on her. Sarastro receives her kindly and assures her that he wishes only for her happiness. But he refuses to return her to her mother, whom he describes as a proud, headstrong woman, and a bad influence on those around her. Pamina, he says, must be guided by a man.\nMonostatos brings in Tamino. The two lovers see one another for the first time and embrace, causing indignation among Sarastro's followers. Monostatos tells Sarastro that he caught Papageno and Pamina trying to escape, and demands a reward. Sarastro, however, punishes Monostatos for his lustful behaviour toward Pamina, and sends him away. He announces that Tamino must undergo trials of wisdom in order to become worthy as Pamina's husband. The priests declare that virtue and righteousness will sanctify life and make mortals like gods (\"Wenn Tugend und Gerechtigkeit\").\nAct 2\nScene 1: A grove of palms\nThe council of priests of Isis and Osiris, headed by Sarastro, enters to the sound of a solemn march. Sarastro tells the priests that Tamino is ready to undergo the ordeals that will lead to enlightenment. He invokes the gods Isis and Osiris, asking them to protect Tamino and Pamina (Aria and chorus: \"O Isis und Osiris\").\nScene 2: The courtyard of the Temple of Ordeal\nTamino and Papageno are led in by two priests for the first trial. The two priests advise Tamino and Papageno of the dangers ahead of them, warn them of women's wiles and swear them to silence (Duet: \"Bewahret euch von Weibert\u00fccken\"). The three ladies appear and try to frighten Tamino and Papageno into speaking. (Quintet: \"Wie, wie, wie\") Papageno cannot resist answering the ladies, but Tamino remains aloof, angrily instructing Papageno not to listen to the ladies' threats and to keep quiet. Seeing that Tamino will not speak to them, the ladies withdraw in confusion.\nScene 3: A garden\nPamina is asleep. Monostatos approaches and gazes upon her with rapture. (Aria: \"Alles f\u00fchlt der Liebe Freuden\") He is about to kiss the sleeping Pamina, when the Queen of the Night appears. Monostatos hides. In response to the Queen's questioning, Pamina explains that Tamino is joining Sarastro's brotherhood and she is thinking of accompanying him too. The Queen is not pleased. She explains that her husband was the previous owner of the temple and on his deathbed, gave the ownership to Sarastro instead of her, rendering the Queen powerless (this is in the original libretto, but is usually omitted from modern productions, to shorten the scene with Pamina and her mother). She gives Pamina a dagger, ordering her to kill Sarastro with it and threatening to disown her if she does not. (Aria: \"Der H\u00f6lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen\"). She leaves. Monostatos returns and tries to force Pamina's love by threatening to reveal the Queen's plot, but Sarastro enters and drives him off. Pamina begs Sarastro to forgive her mother and he reassures her that revenge and cruelty have no place in his domain (Aria: \"In diesen heil'gen Hallen\").\nScene 4: A hall in the Temple of Ordeal\nTamino and Papageno are led in by priests, who remind them that they must remain silent. Papageno complains of thirst. An old woman enters and offers Papageno a cup of water. He drinks and teasingly asks whether she has a boyfriend. She replies that she does and that his name is Papageno. She disappears as Papageno asks for her name, and the three child-spirits bring in food, the magic flute, and the bells, sent from Sarastro (Trio: \"Seid uns zum zweiten Mal willkommen\"). Tamino begins to play the flute, which summons Pamina. She tries to speak with him, but Tamino, bound by his vow of silence, cannot answer her, and Pamina begins to believe that he no longer loves her. (Aria: \"Ach, ich f\u00fchl's, es ist verschwunden\") She leaves in despair.\nScene 5: The pyramids\nThe priests celebrate Tamino's successes so far, and pray that he will succeed and become worthy of their order (Chorus: \"O Isis und Osiris\"). Pamina is brought in and Sarastro instructs Pamina and Tamino to bid each other farewell before the greater trials ahead, alarming them by describing it as their \"final farewell\". (Trio: Sarastro, Pamina, Tamino \u2013 \"Soll ich dich, Teurer, nicht mehr sehn?\" Note: In order to preserve the continuity of Pamina's suicidal feelings, this trio is sometimes performed earlier in act 2, preceding or immediately following Sarastro's aria \"O Isis und Osiris\".[f][30]) They exit and Papageno enters. The priests grant his request for a glass of wine and he expresses his desire for a wife. (Aria: \"Ein M\u00e4dchen oder Weibchen\"). The elderly woman reappears and warns him that unless he immediately promises to marry her, he will be imprisoned forever. When Papageno promises to love her faithfully (muttering that he will only do this until something better comes along), she is transformed into the young and pretty Papagena. Papageno rushes to embrace her, but the priests drive him back, telling him that he is not yet worthy of her.\nFinale. Scene 6: A garden\nThe three child-spirits hail the dawn. They observe Pamina, who is contemplating suicide because she believes Tamino has abandoned her. The child-spirits restrain her and reassure her of Tamino's love. (Quartet: \"Bald prangt, den Morgen zu verk\u00fcnden\").\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 7: Outside the Temple of Ordeal\nTwo men in armor lead in Tamino. They recite one of the formal creeds of Isis and Osiris, promising enlightenment to those who successfully overcome the fear of death (\"Der, welcher wandert diese Strasse voll Beschwerden\"). This recitation takes the musical form of a Baroque chorale prelude, to a tune inspired by Martin Luther's hymn \"Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein\" (Oh God, look down from heaven).[g][32] Tamino declares that he is ready to be tested. Pamina calls to him from offstage. The men in armour assure him that the trial by silence is over and he is free to speak with her. Pamina enters and declares her intention to undergo the remaining trials with him. She hands him the magic flute to help them through the trials (\"Tamino mein, o welch ein Gl\u00fcck!\"). Protected by the music of the magic flute, they pass unscathed through chambers of fire and water. Offstage, the priests hail their triumph and invite the couple to enter the temple.\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 8: A garden with a tree\nPapageno despairs at having lost Papagena and decides to hang himself (Aria/Quartet: \"Papagena! Papagena! Papagena! Weibchen, T\u00e4ubchen, meine Sch\u00f6ne\") The three child-spirits appear and stop him. They advise him to play his magic bells to summon Papagena. She appears and, united, the happy couple stutter in astonishment and make bird-like courting sounds at each other. They plan their future and dream of the many children they will have together (Duet: \"Pa... pa... pa...\").\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 9: A rocky landscape outside the temple; night\nThe traitorous Monostatos appears with the Queen of the Night and her three ladies. They plot to destroy the temple (\"Nur stille, stille\") and the Queen confirms that she has promised her daughter Pamina to Monostatos. But before the conspirators can enter the temple, they are magically cast out into eternal night.\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 10: The Temple of the Sun\nSarastro announces the sun's triumph over the night, and hails the dawn of a new era of wisdom and brotherhood. Animals appear again and dance in the sun.",

The Queen leaves and the ladies remove the padlock from Papageno's mouth with a warning not to lie any more. They give Tamino a magic flute which has the power to change sorrow into joy. They tell Papageno to go with Tamino, and give him (Papageno) magic bells for protection. The ladies introduce three child-spirits, who will guide Tamino and Papageno to Sarastro's temple. Together Tamino and Papageno set forth (Quintet: \"Hm! Hm! Hm! Hm!\").\nScene 2: A room in Sarastro's palace\nPamina is dragged in by Sarastro's slaves, apparently having tried to escape. Monostatos, a blackamoor and chief of the slaves, orders the slaves to chain her and leave him alone with her. Papageno, sent ahead by Tamino to help find Pamina, enters (Trio: \"Du feines T\u00e4ubchen, nur herein!\"). Monostatos and Papageno are each terrified by the other's strange appearance and both flee. Papageno returns and announces to Pamina that her mother has sent Tamino to save her. Pamina rejoices to hear that Tamino is in love with her. She offers sympathy and hope to Papageno, who longs for a wife. Together they reflect on the joys and sacred duties of marital love (duet: \"Bei M\u00e4nnern welche Liebe f\u00fchlen\").\nFinale. Scene 3: A grove in front of a temple\nThe three child-spirits lead Tamino to Sarastro's temple, promising that if he remains patient, wise and steadfast, he will succeed in rescuing Pamina (Quartet: \"Zum Ziele f\u00fchrt dich diese Bahn\"). Tamino approaches the left-hand entrance and is denied access by voices from within. The same happens when he goes to the entrance on the right. But from the entrance in the middle, an old priest appears and lets Tamino in. (The old priest is referred to as \"The Speaker\" in the libretto, but his role is a singing role.) He tells Tamino that Sarastro is benevolent, not evil, and that he should not trust the Queen of the Night. He promises that Tamino's confusion will be lifted when Tamino approaches the temple in a spirit of friendship. Tamino plays his magic flute. Animals appear and dance, enraptured, to his music. Tamino hears Papageno's pipes sounding offstage, and hurries off to find him (aria: \"Wie stark ist nicht dein Zauberton\").\nPapageno and Pamina enter, searching for Tamino (trio: \"Schnelle F\u00fc\u00dfe, rascher Mut\"). They are recaptured by Monostatos and his slaves. Papageno plays his magic bells, and Monostatos and his slaves begin to dance, and exit the stage, still dancing, mesmerised by the beauty of the music (chorus: \"Das klinget so herrlich\"). Papageno and Pamina hear the sound of Sarastro's retinue approaching. Papageno is frightened and asks Pamina what they should say. She answers that they must tell the truth. Sarastro enters, with a crowd of followers. (chorus: \"Es lebe Sarastro!\")\nPamina falls at Sarastro's feet and confesses that she tried to escape because Monostatos had forced his attentions on her. Sarastro receives her kindly and assures her that he wishes only for her happiness. But he refuses to return her to her mother, whom he describes as a proud, headstrong woman, and a bad influence on those around her. Pamina, he says, must be guided by a man.\nMonostatos brings in Tamino. The two lovers see one another for the first time and embrace, causing indignation among Sarastro's followers. Monostatos tells Sarastro that he caught Papageno and Pamina trying to escape, and demands a reward. Sarastro, however, punishes Monostatos for his lustful behaviour toward Pamina, and sends him away. He announces that Tamino must undergo trials of wisdom in order to become worthy as Pamina's husband. The priests declare that virtue and righteousness will sanctify life and make mortals like gods (\"Wenn Tugend und Gerechtigkeit\").\nAct 2\nScene 1: A grove of palms\nThe council of priests of Isis and Osiris, headed by Sarastro, enters to the sound of a solemn march. Sarastro tells the priests that Tamino is ready to undergo the ordeals that will lead to enlightenment. He invokes the gods Isis and Osiris, asking them to protect Tamino and Pamina (Aria and chorus: \"O Isis und Osiris\").\nScene 2: The courtyard of the Temple of Ordeal\nTamino and Papageno are led in by two priests for the first trial. The two priests advise Tamino and Papageno of the dangers ahead of them, warn them of women's wiles and swear them to silence (Duet: \"Bewahret euch von Weibert\u00fccken\"). The three ladies appear and try to frighten Tamino and Papageno into speaking. (Quintet: \"Wie, wie, wie\") Papageno cannot resist answering the ladies, but Tamino remains aloof, angrily instructing Papageno not to listen to the ladies' threats and to keep quiet. Seeing that Tamino will not speak to them, the ladies withdraw in confusion.\nScene 3: A garden\nPamina is asleep. Monostatos approaches and gazes upon her with rapture. (Aria: \"Alles f\u00fchlt der Liebe Freuden\") He is about to kiss the sleeping Pamina, when the Queen of the Night appears. Monostatos hides. In response to the Queen's questioning, Pamina explains that Tamino is joining Sarastro's brotherhood and she is thinking of accompanying him too. The Queen is not pleased. She explains that her husband was the previous owner of the temple and on his deathbed, gave the ownership to Sarastro instead of her, rendering the Queen powerless (this is in the original libretto, but is usually omitted from modern productions, to shorten the scene with Pamina and her mother). She gives Pamina a dagger, ordering her to kill Sarastro with it and threatening to disown her if she does not. (Aria: \"Der H\u00f6lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen\"). She leaves. Monostatos returns and tries to force Pamina's love by threatening to reveal the Queen's plot, but Sarastro enters and drives him off. Pamina begs Sarastro to forgive her mother and he reassures her that revenge and cruelty have no place in his domain (Aria: \"In diesen heil'gen Hallen\").\nScene 4: A hall in the Temple of Ordeal\nTamino and Papageno are led in by priests, who remind them that they must remain silent. Papageno complains of thirst. An old woman enters and offers Papageno a cup of water. He drinks and teasingly asks whether she has a boyfriend. She replies that she does and that his name is Papageno. She disappears as Papageno asks for her name, and the three child-spirits bring in food, the magic flute, and the bells, sent from Sarastro (Trio: \"Seid uns zum zweiten Mal willkommen\"). Tamino begins to play the flute, which summons Pamina. She tries to speak with him, but Tamino, bound by his vow of silence, cannot answer her, and Pamina begins to believe that he no longer loves her. (Aria: \"Ach, ich f\u00fchl's, es ist verschwunden\") She leaves in despair.\nScene 5: The pyramids\nThe priests celebrate Tamino's successes so far, and pray that he will succeed and become worthy of their order (Chorus: \"O Isis und Osiris\"). Pamina is brought in and Sarastro instructs Pamina and Tamino to bid each other farewell before the greater trials ahead, alarming them by describing it as their \"final farewell\". (Trio: Sarastro, Pamina, Tamino \u2013 \"Soll ich dich, Teurer, nicht mehr sehn?\" Note: In order to preserve the continuity of Pamina's suicidal feelings, this trio is sometimes performed earlier in act 2, preceding or immediately following Sarastro's aria \"O Isis und Osiris\".[f][30]) They exit and Papageno enters. The priests grant his request for a glass of wine and he expresses his desire for a wife. (Aria: \"Ein M\u00e4dchen oder Weibchen\"). The elderly woman reappears and warns him that unless he immediately promises to marry her, he will be imprisoned forever. When Papageno promises to love her faithfully (muttering that he will only do this until something better comes along), she is transformed into the young and pretty Papagena. Papageno rushes to embrace her, but the priests drive him back, telling him that he is not yet worthy of her.\nFinale. Scene 6: A garden\nThe three child-spirits hail the dawn. They observe Pamina, who is contemplating suicide because she believes Tamino has abandoned her. The child-spirits restrain her and reassure her of Tamino's love. (Quartet: \"Bald prangt, den Morgen zu verk\u00fcnden\").\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 7: Outside the Temple of Ordeal\nTwo men in armor lead in Tamino. They recite one of the formal creeds of Isis and Osiris, promising enlightenment to those who successfully overcome the fear of death (\"Der, welcher wandert diese Strasse voll Beschwerden\"). This recitation takes the musical form of a Baroque chorale prelude, to a tune inspired by Martin Luther's hymn \"Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein\" (Oh God, look down from heaven).[g][32] Tamino declares that he is ready to be tested. Pamina calls to him from offstage. The men in armour assure him that the trial by silence is over and he is free to speak with her. Pamina enters and declares her intention to undergo the remaining trials with him. She hands him the magic flute to help them through the trials (\"Tamino mein, o welch ein Gl\u00fcck!\"). Protected by the music of the magic flute, they pass unscathed through chambers of fire and water. Offstage, the priests hail their triumph and invite the couple to enter the temple.\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 8: A garden with a tree\nPapageno despairs at having lost Papagena and decides to hang himself (Aria/Quartet: \"Papagena! Papagena! Papagena! Weibchen, T\u00e4ubchen, meine Sch\u00f6ne\") The three child-spirits appear and stop him. They advise him to play his magic bells to summon Papagena. She appears and, united, the happy couple stutter in astonishment and make bird-like courting sounds at each other. They plan their future and dream of the many children they will have together (Duet: \"Pa... pa... pa...\").\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 9: A rocky landscape outside the temple; night\nThe traitorous Monostatos appears with the Queen of the Night and her three ladies. They plot to destroy the temple (\"Nur stille, stille\") and the Queen confirms that she has promised her daughter Pamina to Monostatos. But before the conspirators can enter the temple, they are magically cast out into eternal night.\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 10: The Temple of the Sun\nSarastro announces the sun's triumph over the night, and hails the dawn of a new era of wisdom and brotherhood. Animals appear again and dance in the sun.",

I Rossinis opera har den fiffige Figaro endnu ikke m\u00f8dt sin udk\u00e5rne Susanna - han hj\u00e6lper derimod sin elskovssyge ven Grev Almaviva med at vriste den eftertragtede Rosina ud af hendes griske v\u00e6rge Don Bartolos klamme h\u00e6nder.\n\nMartin Lyngbos tempofyldte slapstick-iscenes\u00e6ttelse fremh\u00e6ver den lette og lystige historie med Rossinis i\u00f8refaldende musik. Barberen i Sevilla h\u00f8stede fremragende anmeldelser ved premieren i 2018. Pressen skrev blandt andet, at \u201cid\u00e9en om at overs\u00e6tte Rossinis komiske opera Barberen i Sevilla til stumfilm er t\u00e6t p\u00e5 genial.\u201d\n\nTheodore Platt fra Den Kongelige Operas solistensemble og Dean Murphy kan opleves i titelrollen, og grev Almaviva synges alternerende af den store Rossinisanger Sunnyboy Dladla og anmelderroste Liam Bonthrone.\n\nDenne forrygende og h\u00e6sbl\u00e6sende udgave af Barberen i Sevilla er musikalsk og visuelt underholdende for b\u00e5de nye operag\u00e6ster og garvede operafans, der s\u00e6tter pris p\u00e5 klassikerne i nye kl\u00e6der."
