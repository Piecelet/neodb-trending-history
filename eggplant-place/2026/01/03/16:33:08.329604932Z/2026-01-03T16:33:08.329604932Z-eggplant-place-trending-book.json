Fascism is not an aberration, he points out, but a \"rational\" and integral component of the system.\"\u2014Stan Goff, The Prism", "id": "https://eggplant.place/book/5OcMK2A7Ve0GsD5O5a7LQK", "uuid": "5OcMK2A7Ve0GsD5O5a7LQK", "url": "/book/5OcMK2A7Ve0GsD5O5a7LQK", "api_url": "/api/book/5OcMK2A7Ve0GsD5O5a7LQK", "category": "book", "parent_uuid": "1CAUh8iPubuDNRtuZrlhvH", "display_title": "Blackshirts and Reds", "external_resources": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/404273"}]}, {"type": "Edition", "title": "The Three-Body Problem", "description": "Set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens.

The satisfying conclusion offers shocking last-minute twists, incredible acts of courage, powerful new forms of magic, and the resolution of many mysteries. Above all, this intense, cathartic book serves as a clear statement of the message at the heart of the Harry Potter series: that choice matters much more than destiny, and that love will always triumph over death.\n \n Series Information: Eleven-year-old Harry Potter is an orphan living with his cruel aunt and uncle when he makes a discovery that will change his life forever: he is a wizard. He is whisked away to the mystical Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magical skills, from potions to spells to flying on broomsticks. But an evil power is rising, the same one that threatened to destroy the entire world when Harry was only a baby. As Harry learns the truth about his family, his childhood, and his mysterious lightning-bolt-shaped scar, he finds unforgettable friendship, a loving surrogate family, and the courage to face the darkest force ever to menace the wizarding world. These charming and engrossing books bring an intensely detailed and captivating world to life and are perfect for enjoying individually or reading aloud."}], "cover_image_url": "https://eggplant.place/m/item/goodreads/2025/01/24/5f40e7c8-dca1-44e5-be0f-b9b222478df3.jpg", "rating": null, "rating_count": 4, "rating_distribution": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "tags": [], "brief": "Harry has been burdened with a dark, dangerous and seemingly impossible task: that of locating and destroying Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes.

This volume from Goldsmiths Press examines not only the unexpected resilience of TV as cultural pastime and aesthetic practice but also the prospects for public service television in a digital, multichannel ecology. \n\nThe proliferation of platforms from Amazon and Netflix to YouTube and the vlogosphere means intense competition for audiences traditionally dominated by legacy broadcasters.

Born in the more stable political and cultural conditions of the twentieth century, they face a range of pressures on their revenue, their remits, and indeed their very futures. \n\nThis book reflects on the issues raised in Lord Puttnam's 2016 Public Service TV Inquiry Report, with contributions from leading broadcasters, academics, and regulators.
