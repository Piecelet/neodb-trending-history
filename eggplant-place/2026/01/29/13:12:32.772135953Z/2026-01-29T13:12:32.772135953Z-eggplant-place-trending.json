But toxic masculinity punishes those fundamental emotions, and it\u2019s so deeply ingrained in our society that it\u2019s hard for men to not comply\u2014but hooks wants to help change that.\n\nWith trademark candor and fierce intelligence, hooks addresses the most common concerns of men, such as fear of intimacy and loss of their patriarchal place in society, in new and challenging ways. She believes men can find the way to spiritual unity by getting back in touch with the emotionally open part of themselves\u2014and lay claim to the rich and rewarding inner lives that have historically been the exclusive province of women.

The novel's vision of Soviet life in the 1930s is so ferociously accurate that it could not be published during its author's lifetime and appeared only in a censored edition in the 1960s. Its truths are so enduring that its language has become part of the common Russian speech.\nOne hot spring, the devil arrives in Moscow, accompanied by a retinue that includes a beautiful naked witch and an immense talking black cat with a fondness for chess and vodka. The visitors quickly wreak havoc in a city that refuses to believe in either God or Satan. But they also bring peace to two unhappy Muscovites: one is the Master, a writer pilloried for daring to write a novel about Christ and Pontius Pilate; the other is Margarita, who loves the Master so deeply that she is willing literally to go to hell for him. What ensues is a novel of in exhaustible energy, humor, and philosophical depth, a work whose nuances emerge for the first time in Diana Burgin's and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor's splendid English version.\n(back cover)",

This is the story of us.\u201d \u2013 Slate\n\n\u201cEarnest and empathetic.\u201d \u2013 The New York Times\n\nTuberculosis has been entwined with humanity for millennia. Once romanticized as a malady of poets, today tuberculosis is seen as a disease of poverty that walks the trails of injustice and inequity we blazed for it.\n\nIn 2019, author John Green met Henry Reider, a young tuberculosis patient at Lakka Government Hospital in Sierra Leone. John became fast friends with Henry, a boy with spindly legs and a big, goofy smile. In the years since that first visit to Lakka, Green has become a vocal advocate for increased access to treatment and wider awareness of the healthcare inequities that allow this curable, preventable infectious disease to also be the deadliest, killing over a million people every year.\n\nIn Everything Is Tuberculosis, John tells Henry\u2019s story, woven through with the scientific and social histories of how tuberculosis has shaped our world\u2014and how our choices will shape the future of tuberculosis.",

Since then, the Caribbean and its peoples have paid the price of relentless Western exploitation and abuses, falling prey to the planting of sugarcane and other cash crops. In Dark Laboratory, Goffe embarks on a historical journey into the influences that have made these islands\u2014from Jamaica and Aruba to Cuba and Martinique\u2014a target of Western capitalism and the foundation of the global economy as we know it today.\n \n Through the lens of personal and family memoir, as well as cultural and social history, Goffe seeks to radically transform how we conceive of Blackness, natural history, colonialism, and the climate crisis. Her writing considers the legacy of slavery and indentured servitude as Chinese laborers worked alongside enslaved Black people to excavate products like sugarcane and guano\u2014in its day more valuable than gold\u2014from these island nations.\n \n How can we combat contemporary racism and environmental degradation using the Caribbean and its dark history as guide? In autobiographical writing that shines light on both environmental upheaval and racial subjugation, Goffe offers solutions based on island ecologies, locating the origins of racism and the climate catastrophe in the colonization of the Caribbean. Her combination of personal narrative and research provides a record of the violence that has shaped these nations and a testament to our capacity for renewal.\n \n In stunning, lyrical prose, Goffe dismantles our longest-held notions about island utopias and proposes new modes of thinking about the ruin and restoration of the environment.",

Neste romance, narrado em primeira pessoa, Lestat d\u00e1 a sua vers\u00e3o dos fatos relatados na c\u00e9lebre entrevista e conta sua fascinante hist\u00f3ria, desde que era um simples mortal no interior da Fran\u00e7a pr\u00e9-revolucion\u00e1ria.\n\n Para escapar da rotina da vida no campo, o jovem Lestat de Lioncourt, seduzido pela fulgurante Paris do s\u00e9culo XVIII, abandona sua fam\u00edlia e segue com uma trupe de atores para trabalhar no teatro.

We follow him through public school and Cambridge, and on into his father's firm, Hill and Hall, Stock Brokers. In a highly structured society, Maurice is a conventional young man in almost every way, \"stepping into the niche that England had prepared for him\": except that his is homosexual. Written during 1913 and 1914, immediately after \"Howards End,\" and not published until 1971, \" Maurice\" was ahead of its time in its theme and in its affirmation that love between men can be happy. \"Happiness,\" Forster wrote, \"is its keynote. In \"Maurice\" I tried to create a character who was completely unlike myself or what I supposed myself to be: someone handsome, healthy, bodily attractive, mentally torpid, not a bad businessman and rather a snob. Into this mixture I dropped an ingredient that puzzles him, wakes him up, torments him and finally saves him.\"\n\u6ce8\uff1a\u8be5\u4e66\u67093\u4e2a\u5c01\u9762\u5185\u5bb9\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8d27\u54c1\u968f\u673a\u53d1\u9001"

Also new to this collection is \"The Book of Martha\" which asks: What would you do if God granted you the ability\u2014and responsibility\u2014to save humanity from itself?\n \nLike all of Octavia Butler\u2019s best writing, these works of the imagination are parables of the contemporary world. She proves constant in her vigil, an unblinking pessimist hoping to be proven wrong, and one of contemporary literature\u2019s strongest voices.",

            "text": "It's no longer safe for Harry at Hogwarts, so he and his best friends, Ron and Hermione, are on the run. Professor Dumbledore has given them clues about what they need to do to defeat the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, once and for all, but it's up to them to figure out what these hints and suggestions really mean. Their cross-country odyssey has them searching desperately for the answers, while evading capture or death at every turn. At the same time, their friendship, fortitude, and sense of right and wrong are tested in ways they never could have imagined. The ultimate battle between good and evil that closes out this final chapter of the epic series takes place where Harry's Wizarding life began: at Hogwarts. The satisfying conclusion offers shocking last-minute twists, incredible acts of courage, powerful new forms of magic, and the resolution of many mysteries. Above all, this intense, cathartic book serves as a clear statement of the message at the heart of the Harry Potter series: that choice matters much more than destiny, and that love will always triumph over death.\n \n Series Information: Eleven-year-old Harry Potter is an orphan living with his cruel aunt and uncle when he makes a discovery that will change his life forever: he is a wizard. He is whisked away to the mystical Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magical skills, from potions to spells to flying on broomsticks. But an evil power is rising, the same one that threatened to destroy the entire world when Harry was only a baby. As Harry learns the truth about his family, his childhood, and his mysterious lightning-bolt-shaped scar, he finds unforgettable friendship, a loving surrogate family, and the courage to face the darkest force ever to menace the wizarding world. These charming and engrossing books bring an intensely detailed and captivating world to life and are perfect for enjoying individually or reading aloud."

In the context of a permanent housing crisis and governments in the pocket of real estate interests,  Abolish Rent  reorients the politics of housing around tenants political actors who can, through organizing, direct action, and collective bargaining, bring about a housing system that meets their needs.\u00a0\n \n  Abolish Rent  is the first book-length engagement with the resurgent tenant movement. Authors Tracy Rosenthal and Leonardo Vilchis\u2014cofounders of Los Angles\u2019s many thousand member tenant union\u2014offer a deeply-reported account centering poor and working class tenants who are fighting back, staying put, and remaking the city in the process. They take us to trilingual strategy meetings, raucous marches against gentrification, and daring eviction defenses where immigrants put their lives on the line.\u00a0\n \n If rent abolition is our aim, tenant power must be the means\u2014built through everyday resistance in our buildings and on our blocks.

        "description": "A previously unpublished collection of Rodney's essays on Marxism, spanning his engagement with of Black Power, Ujamaa Villages, and the everyday people who put an end to a colonial era  Early in life, Walter Rodney became a major revolutionary figure in a dizzying range of locales that traversed the breadth of the Black diaspora: in North America and Europe, in the Caribbean, and on the African continent. He was not only a witness of a Pan-African and socialist internationalism; in his efforts to build mass organizations, catalyze rebellious ferment, and theorize an anti-colonial path to self-emancipation, he can be counted among its prime authors. In drawing together pages where he elaborates on the nexus of race and class, offers his reflections on radical pedagogy, outlines programs for newly independent nation-states, considers the challenges of anti-colonial historiography, and produces balance sheets for a dozen wars for national liberation, this volume captures something of the range and power of Rodney's output. But it also demonstrates the unbending consistency that unites his life and work: the ongoing reinvention of living conception of Marxism, and a respect for the still untapped potential of mass self-rule.",

The game was ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards.\n\nTomoya Okazaki is a third year high school student at Hikarizaka Private High School, leading a life full of resentment. His mother passed away in a car accident when he was young, leading his father, Naoyuki, to resort to alcohol and gambling to cope. This resulted in constant fights between the two until Naoyuki dislocated Tomoya\u2019s shoulder. Unable to play on his basketball team, Tomoya began to distance himself from other people. Ever since he has had a distant relationship with his father, naturally becoming a delinquent over time.\n\nWhile on a walk to school, Tomoya meets a strange girl named Nagisa Furukawa, questioning if she likes the school at all. He finds himself helping her, and as time goes by, Tomoya finds his life heading towards a new direction.",

            "text": " Borderlands Collection: Pandora's Box  This title is included in Borderlands Collection: Pandora's Box!\n       \n \n  Informazioni sul gioco A new era of shoot and loot is about to begin. Play as one of four new vault hunters facing off against a massive new world of creatures, psychos and the evil mastermind, Handsome Jack.  Make new friends, arm them with a bazillion weapons and fight alongside them in 4 player co-op on a relentless quest for revenge and redemption across the undiscovered and unpredictable living planet. Key Features:    All-New Characters and All-New Classes:  Four all new playable classes including the Siren, the Commando, the Gunzerker and the Assassin. Step into the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow him to dual-wield any two weapons found in the game. Not only that, you will build on that skill to do more things with two guns than you ever imagined possible. Dual machine guns? Cool. Dual rocket launchers? Of course! Dual Sniper Rifles? Sure, if that\u2019s your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose from!\n \n    Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN:  Share your adventures with friends both online and via LAN. Borderlands 2 features a seamless system enabling you to drop in and drop out of a campaign without ever having to restart the game. On top of that you can even take your new gear from any game to any other!\n \n    World Connected Story:   Find yourself left for dead in the frozen tundra of Pandora as you begin your quest of revenge and redemption. Expose the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the opening of the Vault.)\n \n    87 Bazillion...Everything:  In addition to the new gun system, you will lust after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods and much, much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot!\n \n    Brand new environments on Pandora:  Hunt through entirely brand new areas of Pandora that are more alive than ever!  From the arctic tundra, through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, you\u2019ll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn!\n \n    Brand new enemies:   A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious predatory Stalkers and the Hyperion mechanical army, run by Handsome Jack, are just some of the new enemies in Borderlands 2.  Note: The Mac and Linux versions of Borderlands 2 are available in English, French, Italian, German and Spanish only."

        "description": "Grand Theft Auto IV is an action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\nTwo expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.\n\nGrand Theft Auto IV follows the story of Niko Bellic, a veteran of an unnamed war in Eastern Europe, who is haunted by the betrayal of his 15 man army unit. Ten years later, after a smuggling run goes bad due to a betrayal from a partner, Niko leaves Eastern Europe to escape the anger of his employer, Ray Bulgarin. After six months in the merchant navy (serving aboard the cargo ship the Platypus), and believing the stories of his cousin Roman, Niko comes to Liberty City to pursue the American Dream as well as searching for the traitor of his unit. After his arrival, however, Niko quickly learns that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loansharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion.",

            "text": "Grand Theft Auto IV is an action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\nTwo expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.\n\nGrand Theft Auto IV follows the story of Niko Bellic, a veteran of an unnamed war in Eastern Europe, who is haunted by the betrayal of his 15 man army unit. Ten years later, after a smuggling run goes bad due to a betrayal from a partner, Niko leaves Eastern Europe to escape the anger of his employer, Ray Bulgarin. After six months in the merchant navy (serving aboard the cargo ship the Platypus), and believing the stories of his cousin Roman, Niko comes to Liberty City to pursue the American Dream as well as searching for the traitor of his unit. After his arrival, however, Niko quickly learns that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loansharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion."

        "brief": "Grand Theft Auto IV is an action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\nTwo expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.\n\nGrand Theft Auto IV follows the story of Niko Bellic, a veteran of an unnamed war in Eastern Europe, who is haunted by the betrayal of his 15 man army unit. Ten years later, after a smuggling run goes bad due to a betrayal from a partner, Niko leaves Eastern Europe to escape the anger of his employer, Ray Bulgarin. After six months in the merchant navy (serving aboard the cargo ship the Platypus), and believing the stories of his cousin Roman, Niko comes to Liberty City to pursue the American Dream as well as searching for the traitor of his unit. After his arrival, however, Niko quickly learns that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loansharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion.",

Un'intera generazione \u00e8 nata e cresciuta nelle profondit\u00e0 del sottosuolo.

        "brief": "Based on the Russian novel Metro 2033 by Dmitry Glukhovsky, Metro: Last Light is a post-apocalyptic horror first-person shooter that serves as a new chapter in the Metro saga and is the sequel to Metro 2033. Like its predecessor, the game is a primarily story-driven shooter with heavy stealth elements. Artyom may carry up to three weapons at a time, however bullets are scarce and valuable to the point that higher grade bullets are, in fact, the Metro's currency. When dealing with armed opponents, stealth is encouraged and it is wise to save ammunition for the many mutant creatures encountered in combat.

The Game builds upon cooperatively focused gameplay and Valve's proprietary Source engine, the same game engine used in the original Left 4 Dead. Set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, Left 4 Dead 2 focuses on four new Survivors, fighting against hordes of the Infected, who develop severe psychosis and exhibit zombie-like tendencies. The Survivors must fight their way through five campaigns, interspersed with safe houses that act as checkpoints, with the goal of escape at each campaign's finale.",

        "brief": "Bethesda Game Studios welcome you to the world of Fallout 4, their most ambitious game ever, and the next generation of open-world gaming. As the sole survivor of Vault 111, you enter a world destroyed by nuclear war. Every second is a fight for survival, and every choice is yours. Only you can rebuild and determine the fate of the Wasteland. Welcome home.\n\nIn Fallout 4, the player takes on the role of the Sole Survivor, emerging from Vault 111 after being cryogenically frozen for 210 years following a nuclear attack in 2077. The main story revolves around the Sole Survivor's search for their kidnapped son, Shaun, in the post-apocalyptic Boston area known as the Commonwealth. Along the way, the player encounters various factions, faces moral dilemmas, and must decide which path to take in rebuilding the Commonwealth.",

        "description": "As Lara Croft races to save the world from a Maya apocalypse, she must become the Tomb Raider she is destined to be.\n\nIn the two months since Rise of the Tomb Raider, Lara Croft and her friend Jonah Maiava have dedicated themselves to stopping the activities of paramilitary organization Trinity. The two track a cell to Cozumel in Mexico that is led by Pedro Dominguez, the head of Trinity's High Council. Slipping inside nearby tombs being excavated by Trinity, Lara discovers a temple containing the Dagger of Chak Chel and references to a hidden city. Murals adorning the walls allude to the Silver Box of Ix Chel and warn of \"the Cleansing\", a Mayan apocalypse culminating in a permanent solar eclipse. Lara ignores the warnings and takes the Dagger to prevent Trinity from acquiring it. Dominguez catches her and reveals that by taking the Dagger, Lara has triggered the Cleansing. He takes the Dagger, intending to unite it with the Box to stop the Cleansing and use the power it grants him to remake the world in his image. Lara and Jonah escape a tsunami that destroys Cozumel and foreshadows the coming apocalypse.\nDespite growing tensions between them over her actions, Lara and Jonah pursue Dominguez into the Amazon. Their plane crashes in the Peruvian jungle during the second cataclysm\u2014a massive storm\u2014and the two find their way to Paititi, the hidden city shown in the murals. Exploring local tombs reveals that piercing the Box with the Dagger will grant the user the power of the god Kukulkan, which must be used to halt the Cleansing. Lara witnesses Trinity soldiers being slaughtered by strange humanoid monsters later identified as the Yaaxil, guardians of the Box. When Lara saves a boy named Etzli, she and Jonah are brought into Paititi by his mother Unuratu, queen of the city. Lara sees Dominguez is the leader of a cult dedicated to Kukulkan and Unuratu reveals he is her brother-in-law Amaru, who was taken by Trinity as a child and raised to complete the ritual and reshape the world in their image. Unuratu directs Lara to the Box, but Lara finds it is missing. Believing the cult already has the Box, Lara, and Unuratu attempt to steal it, but Unuratu is captured. Lara also encounters the Yaaxil and their leader Crimson Fire.\nLara infiltrates the cult's temple and overhears Amaru telling Unuratu that the Box was hidden by Andres Lopez, a missionary sent to Paititi by Trinity during the Spanish conquest of South America. Lara rescues Unuratu and realizes that Amaru does not fully understand the ritual; rather than merely imbuing Kukulkan's power, the ritual sacrifices it to stop the Cleansing. Unuratu is shot by Commander Rourke, Amaru's second in command. Before she dies, Unuratu implores Lara to complete the ritual but warns her not to let the Box influence her. Rourke attacks Lara and Jonah, who are separated as they leave Paititi to decipher the next clue. Thinking Jonah dead, Lara goes on a rampage that destroys an oil refinery and slaughters everyone there except Rourke, who escapes. She momentarily breaks down when she finds Jonah alive, but he manages to calm her, and they decipher the Box's location. Driven mad by the Box, Lopez established a mission near Paititi where he trained acolytes to complete the ritual. Lara and Jonah find a secret catacomb beneath the missiong leading to Lopez's tomb and the Box. Amaru finds them and forces Lara to surrender the Box. He admits that he ordered her father's death to prevent him from finding Paititi and revealing it to the world. Lara tries to persuade Amaru to use the ritual to benefit the world. He refuses, as the Cleansing will only affect Paititi. Amaru has used his position in Trinity to manipulate them into preventing it. He leaves Lara and Jonah to escape the third cataclysm, a massive earthquake that causes a landslide and destroys the mission.\nBack in Paititi, Lara and Jonah help the newly-crowned Etzli lead an assault on an underground temple complex at Paititi's center. They plan to disrupt Amaru's ceremony while avoiding the fourth cataclysm, a volcanic eruption threatening Paititi. Lara is forced to go on alone when Trinity cuts off Etzli's forces. She encounters the Yaaxil and Crimson Fire, convincing them to help her stop Amaru. Lara takes on the symbolic role of Ix Chel while Crimson Fire becomes Chak Chel. While the Yaaxil kill Rourke and the Trinity High Council, Lara makes it to the temple summit. She fails to stop Amaru from piercing the Box and absorbing Kukulkan's power as an eclipse blocks the sun. Lara overpowers Amaru after a lengthy battle; accepting defeat, he transfers Kukulkan's power to Lara as he dies. True to Unuratu's warning, she is tempted to use the Box to revive her parents, but instead lets Crimson Fire symbolically stab her, sacrificing Kukulkan's spirit and stopping the Cleansing. In the aftermath, Unuratu is laid to rest, and Jonah decides to take a vacation. Lara stays in Paititi to help Etzli restore the city to its former glory. A post-credits scene shows Lara planning her next adventure at Croft Manor, acknowledging that her role is not to solve the world's mysteries, but to protect them.",

        "brief": "As Lara Croft races to save the world from a Maya apocalypse, she must become the Tomb Raider she is destined to be.\n\nIn the two months since Rise of the Tomb Raider, Lara Croft and her friend Jonah Maiava have dedicated themselves to stopping the activities of paramilitary organization Trinity. The two track a cell to Cozumel in Mexico that is led by Pedro Dominguez, the head of Trinity's High Council. Slipping inside nearby tombs being excavated by Trinity, Lara discovers a temple containing the Dagger of Chak Chel and references to a hidden city. Murals adorning the walls allude to the Silver Box of Ix Chel and warn of \"the Cleansing\", a Mayan apocalypse culminating in a permanent solar eclipse. Lara ignores the warnings and takes the Dagger to prevent Trinity from acquiring it. Dominguez catches her and reveals that by taking the Dagger, Lara has triggered the Cleansing. He takes the Dagger, intending to unite it with the Box to stop the Cleansing and use the power it grants him to remake the world in his image. Lara and Jonah escape a tsunami that destroys Cozumel and foreshadows the coming apocalypse.\nDespite growing tensions between them over her actions, Lara and Jonah pursue Dominguez into the Amazon. Their plane crashes in the Peruvian jungle during the second cataclysm\u2014a massive storm\u2014and the two find their way to Paititi, the hidden city shown in the murals. Exploring local tombs reveals that piercing the Box with the Dagger will grant the user the power of the god Kukulkan, which must be used to halt the Cleansing. Lara witnesses Trinity soldiers being slaughtered by strange humanoid monsters later identified as the Yaaxil, guardians of the Box. When Lara saves a boy named Etzli, she and Jonah are brought into Paititi by his mother Unuratu, queen of the city. Lara sees Dominguez is the leader of a cult dedicated to Kukulkan and Unuratu reveals he is her brother-in-law Amaru, who was taken by Trinity as a child and raised to complete the ritual and reshape the world in their image. Unuratu directs Lara to the Box, but Lara finds it is missing. Believing the cult already has the Box, Lara, and Unuratu attempt to steal it, but Unuratu is captured. Lara also encounters the Yaaxil and their leader Crimson Fire.\nLara infiltrates the cult's temple and overhears Amaru telling Unuratu that the Box was hidden by Andres Lopez, a missionary sent to Paititi by Trinity during the Spanish conquest of South America. Lara rescues Unuratu and realizes that Amaru does not fully understand the ritual; rather than merely imbuing Kukulkan's power, the ritual sacrifices it to stop the Cleansing. Unuratu is shot by Commander Rourke, Amaru's second in command. Before she dies, Unuratu implores Lara to complete the ritual but warns her not to let the Box influence her. Rourke attacks Lara and Jonah, who are separated as they leave Paititi to decipher the next clue. Thinking Jonah dead, Lara goes on a rampage that destroys an oil refinery and slaughters everyone there except Rourke, who escapes. She momentarily breaks down when she finds Jonah alive, but he manages to calm her, and they decipher the Box's location. Driven mad by the Box, Lopez established a mission near Paititi where he trained acolytes to complete the ritual. Lara and Jonah find a secret catacomb beneath the missiong leading to Lopez's tomb and the Box. Amaru finds them and forces Lara to surrender the Box. He admits that he ordered her father's death to prevent him from finding Paititi and revealing it to the world. Lara tries to persuade Amaru to use the ritual to benefit the world. He refuses, as the Cleansing will only affect Paititi. Amaru has used his position in Trinity to manipulate them into preventing it. He leaves Lara and Jonah to escape the third cataclysm, a massive earthquake that causes a landslide and destroys the mission.\nBack in Paititi, Lara and Jonah help the newly-crowned Etzli lead an assault on an underground temple complex at Paititi's center. They plan to disrupt Amaru's ceremony while avoiding the fourth cataclysm, a volcanic eruption threatening Paititi. Lara is forced to go on alone when Trinity cuts off Etzli's forces. She encounters the Yaaxil and Crimson Fire, convincing them to help her stop Amaru. Lara takes on the symbolic role of Ix Chel while Crimson Fire becomes Chak Chel. While the Yaaxil kill Rourke and the Trinity High Council, Lara makes it to the temple summit. She fails to stop Amaru from piercing the Box and absorbing Kukulkan's power as an eclipse blocks the sun. Lara overpowers Amaru after a lengthy battle; accepting defeat, he transfers Kukulkan's power to Lara as he dies. True to Unuratu's warning, she is tempted to use the Box to revive her parents, but instead lets Crimson Fire symbolically stab her, sacrificing Kukulkan's spirit and stopping the Cleansing. In the aftermath, Unuratu is laid to rest, and Jonah decides to take a vacation. Lara stays in Paititi to help Etzli restore the city to its former glory. A post-credits scene shows Lara planning her next adventure at Croft Manor, acknowledging that her role is not to solve the world's mysteries, but to protect them.",

According to The Final Hours of Portal 2, the year is established to be \"somewhere in 2010\"\u2014twelve years after Aperture Science has been abandoned.\n\nThe game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence, about upcoming tests. Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person.[4] Chell is promised cake as her reward if she completes all test chambers.[19]\n\nChell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister; although she is designed to appear encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, tests including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the test. However, GLaDOS declares it must be euthanized in an \"emergency intelligence incinerator\" before Chell can continue.[17] Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled.[20][21]\n\nAfter Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center.[22] GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the \"party escort submission position\", lying face-first on the ground, so that a \"party associate\" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues her escape. In this section, GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center.[11][12] Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem \"The Chariot\", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and Emily Bront\u00eb's \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.[4]\n\nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas. With it removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally, with taunts and juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. Following the announcement of Portal 2, the ending was expanded in a later update. In this retroactive continuity, Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the \"party escort submission position\".[15][23]\n\nThe final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a Black Forest cake,[24] and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. The cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, causing the room to blackout.[25] As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song \"Still Alive\", which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive,[26] that her \"happy\" core was not disabled."

Players assume the role of V, a mercenary outlaw in pursuit of a unique implant that holds the key to immortality. The game allows extensive customization of cyberware, skills, and playstyle. Choices made throughout the journey influence both the narrative and the world.\n\nIn 2077, following an economic collapse sometime during the early 21st century, the United States is forced to rely on large corporations to survive. These corporations deal in a wide range of areas, such as weapons, robotics, cybernetics, pharmaceuticals, communications and biotechnology, and many of these companies operate above the law. The world in between is where decadence, sex and pop culture mix with violent crime, extreme poverty and the unattainable promise of the American Dream. You play as V, a mercenary outlaw deeply embedded in the crime-ridden city of Night City, going after a one-of-a-kind implant that is the key to immortality.",

Gameplay features exploration, combat, character progression, and branching narratives shaped by player choices. Widely acclaimed for its writing, world-building, and depth, it is considered one of the most influential RPGs of its generation.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt concludes the story of the witcher Geralt of Rivia, the series' protagonist, whose story to date has been covered in the previous installments. Geralt's new mission comes in dark times as the mysterious and otherworldly army known as the Wild Hunt invades the Northern Kingdoms, leaving only blood soaked earth and fiery ruin in its wake; and it seems the Witcher is the key to stopping their cataclysmic rampage."

There are thousands of viable character builds to discover as you go.\n \n \n        BEFRIEND GODS, GHOSTS, AND MONSTERS A fully-voiced cast of colorful, larger-than-life characters is waiting to meet you! Grow your relationships with them, and experience thousands of unique story events as you learn about what's really at stake for this big, dysfunctional family. BUILT FOR REPLAYABILITY New surprises await each time you delve into the ever-shifting Underworld, whose guardian bosses will remember you. Use the powerful Mirror of Night to grow permanently stronger, and give yourself a leg up the next time you run away from home. NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE Permanent upgrades mean you don't have to be a god yourself to experience the exciting combat and gripping story. Though, if you happen to be one, crank up the challenge and get ready for some white-knuckle action that will put your well-practiced skills to the test.\n \n \n     SIGNATURE SUPERGIANT STYLE The rich, atmospheric presentation and unique melding of gameplay and narrative that's been core to Supergiant's games is here in full force: spectacular hand-painted environments and a blood-pumping original score bring the Underworld to life."

What begins as a thrilling breakout quickly turns into an unpredictable, emotional adventure unlike anything seen or played before. \n\nA Way Out is an experience that must be played with two players. Each player controls one of the main characters, Leo and Vincent, in a reluctant alliance to break out of prison and gain their freedom. \n\nFeatures    \n\nCHOOSE YOUR CHARACTER -   \n\nLEO - A hardened inmate with escape in his sights, Leo isn't the type to make friends. No matter the obstacle, Leo is willing to get his hands dirty and do whatever it takes to get the job done.   VINCENT - Even though he\u2019s fresh off the prison bus, Vincent is determined to break out. With quick wits and nothing left to lose, he'll prove that he's not to be underestimated by anyone, inside prison or out.\n    \nTOGETHER THEY'LL FIND A WAY OUT - Escaping prison with a complete stranger isn't ideal circumstances, but Leo and Vincent have too much riding on it to second-guess themselves now. As freedom gets closer and closer, they'll have to learn to trust each other if they want to make it to the other side.\nWORK TOGETHER TO BREAK FREE - Use teamwork to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles.\nEXPERIENCE A VARIETY OF GAMEPLAY - Sneak, fight, run, drive, even go for a little fishing along the way.",

Ushering in a new era for the franchise with cutting-edge technology powered by the Fox Engine, MGSV: The Phantom Pain will provide players a first-rate gaming experience as they are offered tactical freedom to carry out open-world missions.\n \n\n \nNine years after the events of MGSV: GROUND ZEROES and the fall of Mother Base, Snake a.k.a.

        "brief": "Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and a prequel to the original Metal Gear. The game has a complex story with long cut-scene sequences, but there are fewer and they are shorter compared to earlier Metal Gear Solid titles. Most of the gameplay mechanics introduced in Ground Zeroes are carried over: it is still an action game and stealth oriented but replaces the linear corridor design from most earlier titles with large open world environments that offer the player unrestricted freedom for the approach. The world has now a real-time day and night cycle and various weather effects that influence enemy behaviour, visibility and sound. Sabotaging or destroying certain structures can also influence other parts of the map.\n\nThe Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has brought a new edge to the Cold War, and in 1984, a one-eyed man with a prosthetic arm appears in the country. Those who know him call him Snake; the legendary mercenary who was once swept from the stage of history and left in a coma by American private intelligence network Cipher. Snake is accompanied by Ocelot, an old friend who saved him from attack when he finally awoke.\n\nNow, Snake\u2019s former partner Kazuhira Miller is being held by the Soviet forces in Afghanistan.\n\nSnake must undertake a solo mission to rescue Miller and prove to the world that the legendary mercenary is not dead and gone.\nThat first step will lead to a path of vengeance against the very Cipher that slaughtered so many of Snake\u2019s men, and to a battle that will embroil the whole world...\n\nWhat started in Ground Zeroes... must finish with \"V.\"",

        "description": "Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Released in 2009, it follows Batman as he battles the Joker, who seizes control of Arkham Asylum and frees its inmates. The game features stealth, combat, and detective elements, with players using Batman's gadgets and skills to subdue enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nSet in a dark, immersive version of Gotham, the story explores Batman\u2019s psychological battle with his foes, including Harley Quinn, Bane, and Scarecrow. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay, atmosphere, and storytelling, becoming a defining title in superhero video games.\n\nAfter the Joker assaults Gotham City Hall, he is caught by Batman and taken to Arkham Asylum, which temporarily houses many members of the Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at Blackgate Prison. Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.\n\nThere, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan\u2014a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength\u2014intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.\n\nAt the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.\n\nBatman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Joker\u2014who is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it.",

            "text": "Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Released in 2009, it follows Batman as he battles the Joker, who seizes control of Arkham Asylum and frees its inmates. The game features stealth, combat, and detective elements, with players using Batman's gadgets and skills to subdue enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nSet in a dark, immersive version of Gotham, the story explores Batman\u2019s psychological battle with his foes, including Harley Quinn, Bane, and Scarecrow. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay, atmosphere, and storytelling, becoming a defining title in superhero video games.\n\nAfter the Joker assaults Gotham City Hall, he is caught by Batman and taken to Arkham Asylum, which temporarily houses many members of the Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at Blackgate Prison. Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.\n\nThere, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan\u2014a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength\u2014intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.\n\nAt the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.\n\nBatman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Joker\u2014who is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it."

        "brief": "Batman: Arkham Asylum is an action-adventure game developed by Rocksteady Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Released in 2009, it follows Batman as he battles the Joker, who seizes control of Arkham Asylum and frees its inmates. The game features stealth, combat, and detective elements, with players using Batman's gadgets and skills to subdue enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nSet in a dark, immersive version of Gotham, the story explores Batman\u2019s psychological battle with his foes, including Harley Quinn, Bane, and Scarecrow. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay, atmosphere, and storytelling, becoming a defining title in superhero video games.\n\nAfter the Joker assaults Gotham City Hall, he is caught by Batman and taken to Arkham Asylum, which temporarily houses many members of the Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at Blackgate Prison. Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of the security and the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.\n\nThere, Batman learns that the Joker returned to the asylum to gain access to Young, who has been developing Titan\u2014a more powerful version of the Venom drug that gives Bane his strength\u2014intending to use it to help patients survive more strenuous therapies. Young learned that the Joker had been funding her research to create an army of superhuman henchmen; her refusal to hand over the formula precipitated Joker's return to the Asylum. While searching for Young, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and the fear toxin, and hallucinates the night of his parents' deaths. After he recovers, Batman destroys Young's Titan formula and rescues Young from Victor Zsasz. An explosion kills Young and the Joker obtains the completed batches of Titan.\n\nAt the Penitentiary, Quinn releases Poison Ivy from her cell before being imprisoned by Batman. Quinn accidentally reveals that Joker has a Titan production facility in the Arkham botanical gardens. Batman travels there and learns that Titan is created by genetically modified plants. He enlists Ivy's help to create an antidote and learns that it can only be made from spores found exclusively in Killer Croc's lair in a sewer. En route to Croc, Batman is again attacked by Scarecrow and overcomes several doses of fear toxin. Meanwhile, Joker injects Ivy with Titan, enhancing her powers. Ivy begins ravaging Arkham Island with giant mutant plants. Pursued by Batman into Croc's lair, Scarecrow is attacked by Croc and dragged underwater. Batman recovers the necessary spores and subdues Croc before returning to the Batcave, but can only synthesize one dose of the antidote before Ivy's plants breach the cave and destroy his equipment.\n\nBatman returns to the botanical gardens and defeats Ivy, halting the rampaging plants. The Joker announces that the preparations for his party are finally complete and Batman travels to the asylum's visitor center where the Joker's applauding henchmen welcome him. The Joker reveals he has recaptured Gordon and tries to shoot him with a Titan-filled dart; Batman leaps to Gordon's defense and is shot instead. Batman attempts to resist the change, and an upset Joker takes an overdose of Titan, mutating into a massive monster. In a makeshift arena on the building's roof, the Joker challenges Batman to a fight as Titan-induced monsters in front of news helicopters. Batman refuses to transform, uses the antidote on himself, and defeats the Titan-affected Joker and his henchmen, knocking his nemesis unconscious with an explosive gel-enhanced punch. In the aftermath, those affected by Titan begin to revert to normal, including the Joker\u2014who is restrained and taken into custody as police officers retake the asylum. Batman overhears a call about a crime led by Two-Face in progress and flies back to Gotham City in the Batwing. In a post-credits scene, a crate of Titan formula is shown floating in the ocean near the asylum when a hand surfaces and grabs it.",

Fly smoothly from deep space to planetary surfaces, with no loading screens, and no limits. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again. \n  Now including...  Play with all major updates since launch: Foundation, Pathfinder, Atlas Rises, NEXT, The Abyss, Visions, the 2.0 BEYOND update, Synthesis, Living Ship, Exo Mech, Desolation and the 3.0 update, ORIGINS, Next Generation, Companions, Expeditions, Prisms, Frontiers, Sentinel, Outlaws, Endurance, Waypoint (4.0),  Fractal, Interceptor, Echoes, Omega, Orbital and Worlds Part I (5.0).\n  And now with added  Cross-Save !\u00a0No Man\u2019s Sky now supports  Cross-Play  and  Cross-Save  between a huge number of platforms including PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 5 Pro, Xbox One and Series X/S, Game Pass, GOG, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, PlayStation VR 1 \u0026 2 and PCVR.\n  \n  Available for PC and Mac (see recommended and minimum specs for details). \n  \n  An epic voyage to the centre of a shared universe awaits, allowing you to explore, trade, fight and survive alone or with friends. \n  Embark on an epic voyage  At the centre of the galaxy lies a irresistible pulse which draws you on a journey towards it to learn the true nature of the cosmos. But, facing hostile creatures and fierce pirates, you'll know that death comes at a cost, and survival will be down to the choices you make over how you upgrade your ship, your weapon and suit. \n  Find your own destiny  Your voyage through No Man's Sky is up to you. Will you be a fighter, preying on the weak and taking their riches, or taking out pirates for their bounties? Power is yours if you upgrade your ship for speed and weaponry. \n  \n  Or a trader? Find rich resources on forgotten worlds and exploit them for the highest prices. Invest in more cargo space and you'll reap huge rewards. \n  Or perhaps an explorer? Go beyond the known frontier and discover places and things that no one has ever seen before.

Estos malhechores tienen buen ojo para los placeres de la vida y las manos tan largas como para quit\u00e1rselos a sus due\u00f1os delante de sus narices.\n  \n  Lo que se traen entre manos en Sea of Thieves es un secreto muy bien guardado, pero tienen trabajo para aquellos piratas que quieran ganarse un poco m\u00e1s de oro mientras se enfrentan a las tripulaciones rivales durante el trayecto. Si quieres ganarte un puesto entre los Contrabandistas, deber\u00e1s empezar por buscar su guarida\u2026  \n  \nDescubre el misterio  \n  No es de extra\u00f1ar que los Contrabandistas sean un grupo discreto, pero seguro que eres m\u00e1s que capaz de descubrir alguna pista sobre sus planes a lo largo y ancho de los mares. Tal vez un pirata curioso y que siempre est\u00e9 alerta pueda descubrir lo que est\u00e1n tramando... \n  \nGuarida de contrabandistas  \n  Cuando trabajes clandestinamente, debes evitar que te vean por los puestos de avanzada. Los contactos de la Liga de contrabandistas se han instalado en guaridas escondidas por el mapa y protegidas por trampas ocultas que tendr\u00e1s que evitar (o usar contra tus rivales) para garantizar una entrega segura.\n  \nIntroducir contrabando \n  La Liga a\u00fan sigue acostumbr\u00e1ndose a la vida en el Sea of Thieves y necesitan que alguien les eche una mano con el transporte de sus mercanc\u00edas. Las rutas de Contrabandistas est\u00e1n disponibles en Alta mar, pueden realizarse desde la mesa de misiones y tienen lugar en una ruta dorada que cambiar\u00e1 cada temporada. Esta ruta tambi\u00e9n est\u00e1 marcada en la mesa de mapas de otros barcos, lo que aumentar\u00e1 el reto de alcanzar el destino sin que la mercanc\u00eda sufra ning\u00fan da\u00f1o.\n  Si encuentras un mensaje en una botella con una marca de contrabandista en otro lugar, tambi\u00e9n tendr\u00e1s la oportunidad de participar en una salida de contrabandistas. Estas Traves\u00edas emergentes pueden proponer varias rutas con mercanc\u00edas m\u00e1s ex\u00f3ticas, pero todas est\u00e1n centradas en transportar cargamentos lujosos y fr\u00e1giles entre las guaridas de contrabandistas. \n  \nMercanc\u00eda clandestina \n  La Liga de contrabandistas busca un bot\u00edn que difiera de los t\u00edpicos cofres del tesoro y calaveras. \u00a1Prefieren decantarse por el arte, el ron de primer\u00edsima calidad e incluso por los barriles de p\u00f3lvora negra extremadamente potentes! \u00c9chales el guante y ver\u00e1s que tienes que tratarlos con cuidado: las botellas de ron se romper\u00e1n si reciben da\u00f1os y, aunque pueden resistir un poco m\u00e1s, los barriles de p\u00f3lvora negra detonan con m\u00e1s fuerza que cualquier otro explosivo entre las olas.\n  \nUn mundo abierto en evoluci\u00f3n \n  Las guaridas no son la \u00fanica prueba de la llegada de la Liga. Esta temporada, los Naufragios de contrabandistas se pueden encontrar mientras surcas las olas e ir\u00e1n llenos de mercanc\u00eda rara y valiosa que valdr\u00e1 la pena rescatar. Algunas de estas mercanc\u00edas ya han sido recogidas por barcos de esqueletos errantes y tambi\u00e9n se pueden encontrar objetos esparcidos por las costas, \u00a1a menos que otra tripulaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s avispada se los quede antes!\n  \nNuevas recompensas de temporada \n  \u00a1Una nueva temporada significa nuevos premios que desbloquear en los 100 niveles de renombre! Gana cosm\u00e9ticos, oro, doblones y hasta monedas antiguas aumentando tu rango y viviendo la aut\u00e9ntica vida pirata.\n  \nAcerca del juego  \nSea of Thieves ofrece la experiencia de piratas definitiva, desde la navegaci\u00f3n y el combate hasta la exploraci\u00f3n y el saqueo: todo para disfrutar de la vida pirata y convertirte en leyenda. No hay funciones establecidas, tienes total libertad para enfrentarte al mundo y a los dem\u00e1s jugadores como desees.\n\nTanto si navegas en grupo o en solitario, acabar\u00e1s cruz\u00e1ndote con otras tripulaciones en esta aventura de mundo compartido..., pero \u00bfser\u00e1n amigos o enemigos? \u00bfC\u00f3mo responder\u00e1s?\n     \nUn enorme mundo abierto \n  Explora un vasto mundo abierto repleto de islas v\u00edrgenes y reinos submarinos.

Wollt ihr also bei den Schmugglern anheuern, sucht als Erstes nach ihren Verstecken \u2026\n  \nL\u00fcftet das Geheimnis \n  Schmuggler sind bekanntlich ein verschwiegener Haufen, doch ihr findet auf den Meeren sicherlich einige Hinweise auf ihre Pl\u00e4ne.

Die Routenfahrten der Schmuggler sind auf dem Offenen Meer verf\u00fcgbar und k\u00f6nnen am Missionstisch gestartet werden.

Quest'orda di criminali ha fiuto per le cose belle della vita e, naturalmente, la mano lesta per sottrarle da sotto il naso dei legittimi proprietari.\n  \n  La vera natura dei loro affari nel Sea of Thieves \u00e8 un segreto ben custodito, ma hanno incarichi per quei pirati che vogliono guadagnare un po' d'oro in pi\u00f9 affrontando ciurme rivali sul loro tragitto. Quindi, se hai intenzione di cimentarti in questa impresa con i Contrabbandieri, comincia a cercare i loro nascondigli...   \n  \nSvela il mistero  \n  I Contrabbandieri, come prevedibile, hanno la bocca cucita, ma di certo da qualche parte nei mari si possono scovare indizi sui loro piani. Forse un pirata dall'occhio attento e dallo spirito curioso riuscir\u00e0 a svelare i loro intrighi... \n  \nI rifugi dei Contrabbandieri  \n  Quando agisci nell\u2019ombra, \u00e8 meglio non farsi beccare negli avamposti. I contatti della Lega dei contrabbandieri, invece, si sono stabiliti nei rifugi nascosti su tutta la mappa, protetti da trappole nascoste che dovrai aggirare (o usare a tuo vantaggio contro i rivali) per garantire una consegna sicura.\n  \nContrabbando di merci \n  La Lega deve ancora abituarsi alla vita nei mari di Sea of Thieves, per cui ha bisogno di una mano per consegnare la merce nel posto giusto.  Disponibili in alto mare, le Scorribande sulla rotta dei Contrabbandieri si possono accettare dal Tavolo delle missioni e si svolgono lungo un tragitto dorato che cambia ogni stagione: un percorso segnato anche sul Tavolo della mappa delle altre navi, rendendo pi\u00f9 arduo portare il carico a destinazione sano e salvo.\n  \nSe da qualche parte trovi un messaggio in bottiglia contrassegnato dai Contrabbandieri, avrai l'opportunit\u00e0 di affrontare un Traffico dei Contrabbandieri. Questi viaggi emergenti propongono diverse rotte con merci ancor pi\u00f9 esotiche, ma hanno come obiettivo il trasporto furtivo di merci fragili e preziose da un rifugio dei contrabbandieri a un altro. \n  \nMerci clandestine \n  Al posto dei soliti forzieri e teschi, la Lega dei contrabbandieri cerca bottini pi\u00f9 rari, che vanno da opere d\u2019arte e rum pregiato fino a potenti barili di polvere nera! Metti le mani su questi bottini, ma dovrai maneggiarli con cura: le bottiglie di rum si romperanno se danneggiate, e anche se i barili di polvere nera possono reggere qualche colpo, la loro esplosione \u00e8 pi\u00f9 potente di qualsiasi altro ordigno presente sui mari.\n  \nUn ambiente in evoluzione \n  I rifugi non sono l'unico segnale dell'arrivo della Lega. I relitti dei contrabbandieri punteggiano i mari in questa stagione, carichi di merci rare e ambite, che valgono una deviazione per essere recuperate. Le navi degli scheletri erranti sono gi\u00e0 pronte a reclamare parte di queste merci, mentre alcuni oggetti sparsi possono anche essere trovati arenati sulle coste, a meno che un altro equipaggio dall'occhio attento non li trovi prima!\n\nNuove ricompense stagionali \n  Ogni stagione porta con s\u00e9 una nuova serie di ricompense, che possono essere sbloccate avanzando tra i 100 livelli di fama! Ottieni oggetti cosmetici, oro, dobloni e perfino monete antiche mentre scali i ranghi vivendo da vero pirata.\n  \n      Informazioni sul gioco  \nSea of Thieves ti coinvolge in un'esperienza piratesca totale, dalla navigazione ai combattimenti, fino all'esplorazione e ai saccheggi: vivi da filibustiere ed entra di diritto nella leggenda. Senza ruoli prestabiliti, disponi della libert\u00e0 pi\u00f9 totale per affrontare il mondo e gli altri giocatori nel modo che preferisci.\n  \nAvventurati in gruppo o in solitaria e incontra altre ciurme di pirati in questo mondo condiviso... Saranno amichevoli oppure ostili? E tu come reagirai?\n  \nUn vasto mondo aperto \n  Esplora un vasto mondo aperto, ricco di isole incontaminate e regni sottomarini. Vai alla ricerca di tesori perduti, fatti una reputazione con le Compagnie di commercio e affronta svariati nemici, dai fantasmi e i lombrichi oceanici fino ai megalodonti e persino il possente kraken.

A hardcore RPG skillset, a vast map, a massively customisable sandbox and a cute tutorial raccoon await the unwary. So how will you die?\n\nThe Knox Event is used to refer to the zombie outbreak that occurs prior to and throughout the game. The event first takes place around Muldraugh and West Point, Kentucky. The incident is considered to have begun on the 4th of July, 1993, American Day of Independence. Just two days later the military evacuated residences from around the affected area and set up blockades in what is now known as the Knox Evacuation. The affected area is given the name: the Exclusion Zone, with the primary camp being south of Louisville.",

Sono passati circa sessanta anni da quando lavorava come capo delle guardie del braccio della morte nel penitenziario di Could Mountain. Durante la grande depressione, nel carcere del sud degli Usa, Edgecomb si occupava di quattro assassini che attendevano di compiere la loro ultima passeggiata lungo il 'Miglio verde', il corridoio rivestito di linoleum verde che li avrebbe condotti nella stanza della sedia elettrica. Fra questi c'era anche John Coffrey, un ragazzone nero condannato per l'omicidio di due gemelline di nove anni. Nonostante avesse le dimensioni e la forza per uccidere chiunque, Coffrey aveva un carattere semplice e ingenuo: era davvero lui il colpevole?"

Auch seine Mutter muss unter den Geschehnissen leiden und s\u00e4mtliche Kosten f\u00fcr die von ihrem Sohn zerst\u00f6rten H\u00f6rger\u00e4te tragen. Einige Jahre sp\u00e4ter, noch immer von Schuldgef\u00fchlen geplagt, macht sich Shoya auf die Suche nach seinem damaligen Opfer. Doch wird die erneute Begegnung der beiden die verwundeten Seelen tats\u00e4chlich heilen k\u00f6nnen?"

Sono passati pochi mesi dalla cattura da parte del MACUSA del perfido e potente Grindelwald e, come da minaccia, il Mago Oscuro sfugge presto alla detenzione, nel corso di una sequenza aerea che stabilisce da subito le caratteristiche dello spettacolo visivo che sta per seguire: vertiginoso, inquieto e acrobatico. Grindelwald ha piani estremi, sul mondo dei maghi e su quello dei non maghi, e si dirige a radunare i suoi seguaci, pescando tra le fila degli scontenti per i metodi repressivi e violenti del Ministero della Magia. Ma in particolare cerca Credence, l'Obscuriale miracolosamente scampato alla morte. Anche Newt Scamander, il timido magizoologo, \u00e8 sulle tracce del ragazzo, per conto di Albus Silente. E naturalmente anche il Ministero, e l'Auror Tina, con la quale Newt ha un malinteso sentimentale in sospeso."

It is a concept album detailing the self-destruction of a man from the beginning of his misanthropic \"downward spiral\" to his suicidal breaking point. The album was a commercial success and established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s music scene, with its sound being widely imitated, and the band receiving media attention and multiple honors. \n\nTrent Reznor, the band's sole official member at the time, had moved to 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, the site of the murder of actress Sharon Tate by members of the Manson Family in 1969; it was transformed into a studio for recording the Broken EP (1992) and subsequently The Downward Spiral. The album features elements of industrial rock, techno, metal and ambient soundscapes, in contrast to the band's synth-pop-influenced debut album Pretty Hate Machine (1989). Reznor was strongly influenced by David Bowie's Low and Pink Floyd's The Wall for their themes of introspection and dissociation, and their focus on texture and space. ",

        "description": "One of the great new wave/early MTV records, She's So Unusual is a giddy mix of self-confidence, effervescent popcraft, unabashed sentimentality, subversiveness, and clever humor. In short, it's a multifaceted portrait of a multifaceted talent, an artist that's far more clever than her thin, deliberately girly voice would indicate. Then again, Lauper's voice suits her musical persona, since its chirpiness adds depth, or reconfigures the songs, whether it's the call to arms of \u0026Girls Just Want to Have Fun\u0026 or the tearjerking \u0026Time After Time.\u0026 Lauper is at her very best on the first side, all of which were singles or received airplay, and this collection of songs -- \u0026Money Changes Everything,\u0026 \u0026Girls,\u0026 \u0026When You Were Mine,\u0026 \u0026Time,\u0026 \u0026She Bop,\u0026 \u0026All Through the Night\u0026 -- is astonishing in its consistency, so strong that it makes the remaining tracks -- all enjoyable, but rather pedestrian -- charming by their association with songs so brilliantly alive. If Lauper couldn't maintain this level of consistency, it's because this captured her persona better than anyone could imagine -- when a debut captures a personality so well, let alone a personality so tied to its time, the successive work can't help but pale in comparison. Still, when it's captured as brightly and brilliantly as it is here, it does result in a debut that retains its potency, long after its production seems a little dated.",

It was released on November 6, 1992, by Epic Records, four days after the release of the album's first single, \"Killing in the Name\". The album was based largely on the band's first commercial demo tape of the same name, completed 11 months prior to the album's release. The tape contained earlier recordings of seven of the ten songs.\n\nWith politically themed, revolutionary lyrical content, the album artwork was notable for its graphic photograph of Vietnamese monk Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c performing self-immolation in June 1963.

Despite the commercial success of Clarkson's debut album Thankful (2003), music critics still continued to typecast her as an American Idol gagnant and were also critical of her attempts of establishing a commercial appeal on her own. Wanting to stray from those, she collaborated with a range of new songwriters and producers such as Dr. Luke, Max Martin, John Shanks, Kara DioGuardi, and with former Evanescence members Ben Moody and David Hodges. This overhaul also led her to part ways with her manager Simon Fuller and hire the management services of Jeff Kwatinetz before the album's release. ",

        "description": "Songs in A Minor is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Alicia Keys. It was released on June 26, 2001, by J Records. A classically trained pianist, Keys wrote, arranged and produced the majority of the album herself, though she frequently worked with her then-partner Kerry \"Krucial\" Brothers. The efforts resulted in a neo soul record fusing contemporary classical music with R\u0026B, soul, and jazz, alongside influences of hip-hop, blues, and gospel. Its lyrics focus on themes of love, perseverance, self-worth, survival, and introspection. Despite the album's title, only two of its tracks are composed in the key of A minor. ",

        "title": "The Magic Flute",
        "description": "The opera begins with the overture, which Mozart composed last.\nAct 1\nScene 1: A rough, rocky landscape\nTamino, a handsome prince lost in a distant land, is pursued by a serpent and asks the gods to save him (aria: \"Zu Hilfe! Zu Hilfe!\" segued into trio: \"Stirb, Ungeheuer, durch uns're Macht!\"). He faints, and three ladies, attendants of the Queen of the Night, appear and kill the serpent. They find the unconscious prince extremely attractive, and each of them tries to convince the other two to leave. After arguing, they reluctantly decide to leave together.\nTamino wakes up, and is surprised to find himself still alive. Papageno enters dressed as a bird. He describes his life as a bird-catcher, complaining he has no wife or girlfriend (aria: \"Der Vogelf\u00e4nger bin ich ja\"). Tamino introduces himself to Papageno, thinking Papageno killed the serpent. Papageno happily takes the credit \u2013 claiming he strangled it with his bare hands. The three ladies suddenly reappear and instead of giving Papageno wine, cake and figs, they give him water, a stone and place a padlock over his mouth as a warning not to lie. They give Tamino a portrait of the Queen of the Night's daughter Pamina, with whom Tamino falls instantly in love (aria: \"Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd sch\u00f6n\" / This image is enchantingly beautiful).\nThe ladies return and tell Tamino that Pamina has been captured by Sarastro, whom they describe as a powerful, evil demon. Tamino vows to rescue Pamina. The Queen of the Night appears and promises Tamino that Pamina will be his if he rescues her from Sarastro (Recitative and aria: \"O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn\" / Oh, tremble not, my dear son!). The Queen leaves and the ladies remove the padlock from Papageno's mouth with a warning not to lie any more. They give Tamino a magic flute which has the power to change sorrow into joy. They tell Papageno to go with Tamino, and give him (Papageno) magic bells for protection. The ladies introduce three child-spirits, who will guide Tamino and Papageno to Sarastro's temple. Together Tamino and Papageno set forth (Quintet: \"Hm! Hm! Hm! Hm!\").\nScene 2: A room in Sarastro's palace\nPamina is dragged in by Sarastro's slaves, apparently having tried to escape. Monostatos, a blackamoor and chief of the slaves, orders the slaves to chain her and leave him alone with her. Papageno, sent ahead by Tamino to help find Pamina, enters (Trio: \"Du feines T\u00e4ubchen, nur herein!\"). Monostatos and Papageno are each terrified by the other's strange appearance and both flee. Papageno returns and announces to Pamina that her mother has sent Tamino to save her. Pamina rejoices to hear that Tamino is in love with her. She offers sympathy and hope to Papageno, who longs for a wife. Together they reflect on the joys and sacred duties of marital love (duet: \"Bei M\u00e4nnern welche Liebe f\u00fchlen\").\nFinale. Scene 3: A grove in front of a temple\nThe three child-spirits lead Tamino to Sarastro's temple, promising that if he remains patient, wise and steadfast, he will succeed in rescuing Pamina (Quartet: \"Zum Ziele f\u00fchrt dich diese Bahn\"). Tamino approaches the left-hand entrance and is denied access by voices from within. The same happens when he goes to the entrance on the right. But from the entrance in the middle, an old priest appears and lets Tamino in. (The old priest is referred to as \"The Speaker\" in the libretto, but his role is a singing role.) He tells Tamino that Sarastro is benevolent, not evil, and that he should not trust the Queen of the Night. He promises that Tamino's confusion will be lifted when Tamino approaches the temple in a spirit of friendship. Tamino plays his magic flute. Animals appear and dance, enraptured, to his music. Tamino hears Papageno's pipes sounding offstage, and hurries off to find him (aria: \"Wie stark ist nicht dein Zauberton\").\nPapageno and Pamina enter, searching for Tamino (trio: \"Schnelle F\u00fc\u00dfe, rascher Mut\"). They are recaptured by Monostatos and his slaves. Papageno plays his magic bells, and Monostatos and his slaves begin to dance, and exit the stage, still dancing, mesmerised by the beauty of the music (chorus: \"Das klinget so herrlich\"). Papageno and Pamina hear the sound of Sarastro's retinue approaching. Papageno is frightened and asks Pamina what they should say. She answers that they must tell the truth. Sarastro enters, with a crowd of followers. (chorus: \"Es lebe Sarastro!\")\nPamina falls at Sarastro's feet and confesses that she tried to escape because Monostatos had forced his attentions on her. Sarastro receives her kindly and assures her that he wishes only for her happiness. But he refuses to return her to her mother, whom he describes as a proud, headstrong woman, and a bad influence on those around her. Pamina, he says, must be guided by a man.\nMonostatos brings in Tamino. The two lovers see one another for the first time and embrace, causing indignation among Sarastro's followers. Monostatos tells Sarastro that he caught Papageno and Pamina trying to escape, and demands a reward. Sarastro, however, punishes Monostatos for his lustful behaviour toward Pamina, and sends him away. He announces that Tamino must undergo trials of wisdom in order to become worthy as Pamina's husband. The priests declare that virtue and righteousness will sanctify life and make mortals like gods (\"Wenn Tugend und Gerechtigkeit\").\nAct 2\nScene 1: A grove of palms\nThe council of priests of Isis and Osiris, headed by Sarastro, enters to the sound of a solemn march. Sarastro tells the priests that Tamino is ready to undergo the ordeals that will lead to enlightenment. He invokes the gods Isis and Osiris, asking them to protect Tamino and Pamina (Aria and chorus: \"O Isis und Osiris\").\nScene 2: The courtyard of the Temple of Ordeal\nTamino and Papageno are led in by two priests for the first trial. The two priests advise Tamino and Papageno of the dangers ahead of them, warn them of women's wiles and swear them to silence (Duet: \"Bewahret euch von Weibert\u00fccken\"). The three ladies appear and try to frighten Tamino and Papageno into speaking. (Quintet: \"Wie, wie, wie\") Papageno cannot resist answering the ladies, but Tamino remains aloof, angrily instructing Papageno not to listen to the ladies' threats and to keep quiet. Seeing that Tamino will not speak to them, the ladies withdraw in confusion.\nScene 3: A garden\nPamina is asleep. Monostatos approaches and gazes upon her with rapture. (Aria: \"Alles f\u00fchlt der Liebe Freuden\") He is about to kiss the sleeping Pamina, when the Queen of the Night appears. Monostatos hides. In response to the Queen's questioning, Pamina explains that Tamino is joining Sarastro's brotherhood and she is thinking of accompanying him too. The Queen is not pleased. She explains that her husband was the previous owner of the temple and on his deathbed, gave the ownership to Sarastro instead of her, rendering the Queen powerless (this is in the original libretto, but is usually omitted from modern productions, to shorten the scene with Pamina and her mother). She gives Pamina a dagger, ordering her to kill Sarastro with it and threatening to disown her if she does not. (Aria: \"Der H\u00f6lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen\"). She leaves. Monostatos returns and tries to force Pamina's love by threatening to reveal the Queen's plot, but Sarastro enters and drives him off. Pamina begs Sarastro to forgive her mother and he reassures her that revenge and cruelty have no place in his domain (Aria: \"In diesen heil'gen Hallen\").\nScene 4: A hall in the Temple of Ordeal\nTamino and Papageno are led in by priests, who remind them that they must remain silent. Papageno complains of thirst. An old woman enters and offers Papageno a cup of water. He drinks and teasingly asks whether she has a boyfriend. She replies that she does and that his name is Papageno. She disappears as Papageno asks for her name, and the three child-spirits bring in food, the magic flute, and the bells, sent from Sarastro (Trio: \"Seid uns zum zweiten Mal willkommen\"). Tamino begins to play the flute, which summons Pamina. She tries to speak with him, but Tamino, bound by his vow of silence, cannot answer her, and Pamina begins to believe that he no longer loves her. (Aria: \"Ach, ich f\u00fchl's, es ist verschwunden\") She leaves in despair.\nScene 5: The pyramids\nThe priests celebrate Tamino's successes so far, and pray that he will succeed and become worthy of their order (Chorus: \"O Isis und Osiris\"). Pamina is brought in and Sarastro instructs Pamina and Tamino to bid each other farewell before the greater trials ahead, alarming them by describing it as their \"final farewell\". (Trio: Sarastro, Pamina, Tamino \u2013 \"Soll ich dich, Teurer, nicht mehr sehn?\" Note: In order to preserve the continuity of Pamina's suicidal feelings, this trio is sometimes performed earlier in act 2, preceding or immediately following Sarastro's aria \"O Isis und Osiris\".[f][30]) They exit and Papageno enters. The priests grant his request for a glass of wine and he expresses his desire for a wife. (Aria: \"Ein M\u00e4dchen oder Weibchen\"). The elderly woman reappears and warns him that unless he immediately promises to marry her, he will be imprisoned forever. When Papageno promises to love her faithfully (muttering that he will only do this until something better comes along), she is transformed into the young and pretty Papagena. Papageno rushes to embrace her, but the priests drive him back, telling him that he is not yet worthy of her.\nFinale. Scene 6: A garden\nThe three child-spirits hail the dawn. They observe Pamina, who is contemplating suicide because she believes Tamino has abandoned her. The child-spirits restrain her and reassure her of Tamino's love. (Quartet: \"Bald prangt, den Morgen zu verk\u00fcnden\").\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 7: Outside the Temple of Ordeal\nTwo men in armor lead in Tamino. They recite one of the formal creeds of Isis and Osiris, promising enlightenment to those who successfully overcome the fear of death (\"Der, welcher wandert diese Strasse voll Beschwerden\"). This recitation takes the musical form of a Baroque chorale prelude, to a tune inspired by Martin Luther's hymn \"Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein\" (Oh God, look down from heaven).[g][32] Tamino declares that he is ready to be tested. Pamina calls to him from offstage. The men in armour assure him that the trial by silence is over and he is free to speak with her. Pamina enters and declares her intention to undergo the remaining trials with him. She hands him the magic flute to help them through the trials (\"Tamino mein, o welch ein Gl\u00fcck!\"). Protected by the music of the magic flute, they pass unscathed through chambers of fire and water. Offstage, the priests hail their triumph and invite the couple to enter the temple.\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 8: A garden with a tree\nPapageno despairs at having lost Papagena and decides to hang himself (Aria/Quartet: \"Papagena! Papagena! Papagena! Weibchen, T\u00e4ubchen, meine Sch\u00f6ne\") The three child-spirits appear and stop him. They advise him to play his magic bells to summon Papagena. She appears and, united, the happy couple stutter in astonishment and make bird-like courting sounds at each other. They plan their future and dream of the many children they will have together (Duet: \"Pa... pa... pa...\").\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 9: A rocky landscape outside the temple; night\nThe traitorous Monostatos appears with the Queen of the Night and her three ladies. They plot to destroy the temple (\"Nur stille, stille\") and the Queen confirms that she has promised her daughter Pamina to Monostatos. But before the conspirators can enter the temple, they are magically cast out into eternal night.\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 10: The Temple of the Sun\nSarastro announces the sun's triumph over the night, and hails the dawn of a new era of wisdom and brotherhood. Animals appear again and dance in the sun.",

The three ladies suddenly reappear and instead of giving Papageno wine, cake and figs, they give him water, a stone and place a padlock over his mouth as a warning not to lie. They give Tamino a portrait of the Queen of the Night's daughter Pamina, with whom Tamino falls instantly in love (aria: \"Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd sch\u00f6n\" / This image is enchantingly beautiful).\nThe ladies return and tell Tamino that Pamina has been captured by Sarastro, whom they describe as a powerful, evil demon. Tamino vows to rescue Pamina. The Queen of the Night appears and promises Tamino that Pamina will be his if he rescues her from Sarastro (Recitative and aria: \"O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn\" / Oh, tremble not, my dear son!). The Queen leaves and the ladies remove the padlock from Papageno's mouth with a warning not to lie any more. They give Tamino a magic flute which has the power to change sorrow into joy. They tell Papageno to go with Tamino, and give him (Papageno) magic bells for protection. The ladies introduce three child-spirits, who will guide Tamino and Papageno to Sarastro's temple. Together Tamino and Papageno set forth (Quintet: \"Hm! Hm! Hm! Hm!\").\nScene 2: A room in Sarastro's palace\nPamina is dragged in by Sarastro's slaves, apparently having tried to escape. Monostatos, a blackamoor and chief of the slaves, orders the slaves to chain her and leave him alone with her. Papageno, sent ahead by Tamino to help find Pamina, enters (Trio: \"Du feines T\u00e4ubchen, nur herein!\"). Monostatos and Papageno are each terrified by the other's strange appearance and both flee. Papageno returns and announces to Pamina that her mother has sent Tamino to save her. Pamina rejoices to hear that Tamino is in love with her. She offers sympathy and hope to Papageno, who longs for a wife. Together they reflect on the joys and sacred duties of marital love (duet: \"Bei M\u00e4nnern welche Liebe f\u00fchlen\").\nFinale. Scene 3: A grove in front of a temple\nThe three child-spirits lead Tamino to Sarastro's temple, promising that if he remains patient, wise and steadfast, he will succeed in rescuing Pamina (Quartet: \"Zum Ziele f\u00fchrt dich diese Bahn\"). Tamino approaches the left-hand entrance and is denied access by voices from within. The same happens when he goes to the entrance on the right. But from the entrance in the middle, an old priest appears and lets Tamino in. (The old priest is referred to as \"The Speaker\" in the libretto, but his role is a singing role.) He tells Tamino that Sarastro is benevolent, not evil, and that he should not trust the Queen of the Night. He promises that Tamino's confusion will be lifted when Tamino approaches the temple in a spirit of friendship. Tamino plays his magic flute. Animals appear and dance, enraptured, to his music. Tamino hears Papageno's pipes sounding offstage, and hurries off to find him (aria: \"Wie stark ist nicht dein Zauberton\").\nPapageno and Pamina enter, searching for Tamino (trio: \"Schnelle F\u00fc\u00dfe, rascher Mut\"). They are recaptured by Monostatos and his slaves. Papageno plays his magic bells, and Monostatos and his slaves begin to dance, and exit the stage, still dancing, mesmerised by the beauty of the music (chorus: \"Das klinget so herrlich\"). Papageno and Pamina hear the sound of Sarastro's retinue approaching. Papageno is frightened and asks Pamina what they should say. She answers that they must tell the truth. Sarastro enters, with a crowd of followers. (chorus: \"Es lebe Sarastro!\")\nPamina falls at Sarastro's feet and confesses that she tried to escape because Monostatos had forced his attentions on her. Sarastro receives her kindly and assures her that he wishes only for her happiness. But he refuses to return her to her mother, whom he describes as a proud, headstrong woman, and a bad influence on those around her. Pamina, he says, must be guided by a man.\nMonostatos brings in Tamino. The two lovers see one another for the first time and embrace, causing indignation among Sarastro's followers. Monostatos tells Sarastro that he caught Papageno and Pamina trying to escape, and demands a reward. Sarastro, however, punishes Monostatos for his lustful behaviour toward Pamina, and sends him away. He announces that Tamino must undergo trials of wisdom in order to become worthy as Pamina's husband. The priests declare that virtue and righteousness will sanctify life and make mortals like gods (\"Wenn Tugend und Gerechtigkeit\").\nAct 2\nScene 1: A grove of palms\nThe council of priests of Isis and Osiris, headed by Sarastro, enters to the sound of a solemn march. Sarastro tells the priests that Tamino is ready to undergo the ordeals that will lead to enlightenment. He invokes the gods Isis and Osiris, asking them to protect Tamino and Pamina (Aria and chorus: \"O Isis und Osiris\").\nScene 2: The courtyard of the Temple of Ordeal\nTamino and Papageno are led in by two priests for the first trial. The two priests advise Tamino and Papageno of the dangers ahead of them, warn them of women's wiles and swear them to silence (Duet: \"Bewahret euch von Weibert\u00fccken\"). The three ladies appear and try to frighten Tamino and Papageno into speaking. (Quintet: \"Wie, wie, wie\") Papageno cannot resist answering the ladies, but Tamino remains aloof, angrily instructing Papageno not to listen to the ladies' threats and to keep quiet. Seeing that Tamino will not speak to them, the ladies withdraw in confusion.\nScene 3: A garden\nPamina is asleep. Monostatos approaches and gazes upon her with rapture. (Aria: \"Alles f\u00fchlt der Liebe Freuden\") He is about to kiss the sleeping Pamina, when the Queen of the Night appears. Monostatos hides. In response to the Queen's questioning, Pamina explains that Tamino is joining Sarastro's brotherhood and she is thinking of accompanying him too. The Queen is not pleased. She explains that her husband was the previous owner of the temple and on his deathbed, gave the ownership to Sarastro instead of her, rendering the Queen powerless (this is in the original libretto, but is usually omitted from modern productions, to shorten the scene with Pamina and her mother). She gives Pamina a dagger, ordering her to kill Sarastro with it and threatening to disown her if she does not. (Aria: \"Der H\u00f6lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen\"). She leaves. Monostatos returns and tries to force Pamina's love by threatening to reveal the Queen's plot, but Sarastro enters and drives him off. Pamina begs Sarastro to forgive her mother and he reassures her that revenge and cruelty have no place in his domain (Aria: \"In diesen heil'gen Hallen\").\nScene 4: A hall in the Temple of Ordeal\nTamino and Papageno are led in by priests, who remind them that they must remain silent. Papageno complains of thirst. An old woman enters and offers Papageno a cup of water. He drinks and teasingly asks whether she has a boyfriend. She replies that she does and that his name is Papageno. She disappears as Papageno asks for her name, and the three child-spirits bring in food, the magic flute, and the bells, sent from Sarastro (Trio: \"Seid uns zum zweiten Mal willkommen\"). Tamino begins to play the flute, which summons Pamina. She tries to speak with him, but Tamino, bound by his vow of silence, cannot answer her, and Pamina begins to believe that he no longer loves her. (Aria: \"Ach, ich f\u00fchl's, es ist verschwunden\") She leaves in despair.\nScene 5: The pyramids\nThe priests celebrate Tamino's successes so far, and pray that he will succeed and become worthy of their order (Chorus: \"O Isis und Osiris\"). Pamina is brought in and Sarastro instructs Pamina and Tamino to bid each other farewell before the greater trials ahead, alarming them by describing it as their \"final farewell\". (Trio: Sarastro, Pamina, Tamino \u2013 \"Soll ich dich, Teurer, nicht mehr sehn?\" Note: In order to preserve the continuity of Pamina's suicidal feelings, this trio is sometimes performed earlier in act 2, preceding or immediately following Sarastro's aria \"O Isis und Osiris\".[f][30]) They exit and Papageno enters. The priests grant his request for a glass of wine and he expresses his desire for a wife. (Aria: \"Ein M\u00e4dchen oder Weibchen\"). The elderly woman reappears and warns him that unless he immediately promises to marry her, he will be imprisoned forever. When Papageno promises to love her faithfully (muttering that he will only do this until something better comes along), she is transformed into the young and pretty Papagena. Papageno rushes to embrace her, but the priests drive him back, telling him that he is not yet worthy of her.\nFinale. Scene 6: A garden\nThe three child-spirits hail the dawn. They observe Pamina, who is contemplating suicide because she believes Tamino has abandoned her. The child-spirits restrain her and reassure her of Tamino's love. (Quartet: \"Bald prangt, den Morgen zu verk\u00fcnden\").\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 7: Outside the Temple of Ordeal\nTwo men in armor lead in Tamino. They recite one of the formal creeds of Isis and Osiris, promising enlightenment to those who successfully overcome the fear of death (\"Der, welcher wandert diese Strasse voll Beschwerden\"). This recitation takes the musical form of a Baroque chorale prelude, to a tune inspired by Martin Luther's hymn \"Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein\" (Oh God, look down from heaven).[g][32] Tamino declares that he is ready to be tested. Pamina calls to him from offstage. The men in armour assure him that the trial by silence is over and he is free to speak with her. Pamina enters and declares her intention to undergo the remaining trials with him. She hands him the magic flute to help them through the trials (\"Tamino mein, o welch ein Gl\u00fcck!\"). Protected by the music of the magic flute, they pass unscathed through chambers of fire and water. Offstage, the priests hail their triumph and invite the couple to enter the temple.\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 8: A garden with a tree\nPapageno despairs at having lost Papagena and decides to hang himself (Aria/Quartet: \"Papagena! Papagena! Papagena! Weibchen, T\u00e4ubchen, meine Sch\u00f6ne\") The three child-spirits appear and stop him. They advise him to play his magic bells to summon Papagena. She appears and, united, the happy couple stutter in astonishment and make bird-like courting sounds at each other. They plan their future and dream of the many children they will have together (Duet: \"Pa... pa... pa...\").\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 9: A rocky landscape outside the temple; night\nThe traitorous Monostatos appears with the Queen of the Night and her three ladies. They plot to destroy the temple (\"Nur stille, stille\") and the Queen confirms that she has promised her daughter Pamina to Monostatos. But before the conspirators can enter the temple, they are magically cast out into eternal night.\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 10: The Temple of the Sun\nSarastro announces the sun's triumph over the night, and hails the dawn of a new era of wisdom and brotherhood. Animals appear again and dance in the sun."

        "brief": "The opera begins with the overture, which Mozart composed last.\nAct 1\nScene 1: A rough, rocky landscape\nTamino, a handsome prince lost in a distant land, is pursued by a serpent and asks the gods to save him (aria: \"Zu Hilfe! Zu Hilfe!\" segued into trio: \"Stirb, Ungeheuer, durch uns're Macht!\"). He faints, and three ladies, attendants of the Queen of the Night, appear and kill the serpent. They find the unconscious prince extremely attractive, and each of them tries to convince the other two to leave. After arguing, they reluctantly decide to leave together.\nTamino wakes up, and is surprised to find himself still alive. Papageno enters dressed as a bird. He describes his life as a bird-catcher, complaining he has no wife or girlfriend (aria: \"Der Vogelf\u00e4nger bin ich ja\").

I Rossinis opera har den fiffige Figaro endnu ikke m\u00f8dt sin udk\u00e5rne Susanna - han hj\u00e6lper derimod sin elskovssyge ven Grev Almaviva med at vriste den eftertragtede Rosina ud af hendes griske v\u00e6rge Don Bartolos klamme h\u00e6nder.\n\nMartin Lyngbos tempofyldte slapstick-iscenes\u00e6ttelse fremh\u00e6ver den lette og lystige historie med Rossinis i\u00f8refaldende musik. Barberen i Sevilla h\u00f8stede fremragende anmeldelser ved premieren i 2018. Pressen skrev blandt andet, at \u201cid\u00e9en om at overs\u00e6tte Rossinis komiske opera Barberen i Sevilla til stumfilm er t\u00e6t p\u00e5 genial.\u201d\n\nTheodore Platt fra Den Kongelige Operas solistensemble og Dean Murphy kan opleves i titelrollen, og grev Almaviva synges alternerende af den store Rossinisanger Sunnyboy Dladla og anmelderroste Liam Bonthrone.\n\nDenne forrygende og h\u00e6sbl\u00e6sende udgave af Barberen i Sevilla er musikalsk og visuelt underholdende for b\u00e5de nye operag\u00e6ster og garvede operafans, der s\u00e6tter pris p\u00e5 klassikerne i nye kl\u00e6der."

        "description": "Les Indes galantes is a ballet h\u00e9ro\u00efque, a type of French Baroque opera-ballet, by Jean-Philippe Rameau with a libretto by Louis Fuzelier. In its final form it comprised an allegorical prologue and four entr\u00e9es, or acts, each set in an exotic place, the whole being unified around the theme of love. The work dates from 1735 except for the last entr\u00e9e, which was added the following year. In 1761, however, Rameau dropped the relatively short and mildly contrasted third entr\u00e9e so as to leave what is now considered the work's definitive form: Prologue; Le turc g\u00e9n\u00e9reux (The Generous Turk); Les incas du P\u00e9rou (The Incas of Peru); and Les sauvages (The Savages of North America). The dropped entr\u00e9e was Les fleurs (The Flowers of Persia). Famous pieces from Les Indes galantes include the Dance of the Peace Pipe and the Chaconne, both from The Savages of North America.[1]",

        "description": "Place: Seville, Spain, and surrounding hills\nTime: Around 1820\nAct 1\nA square, in Seville. On the right, a door to the tobacco factory. At the back, a bridge. On the left, a guardhouse.\nA group of soldiers relaxes in the square, waiting for the changing of the guard and commenting on the passers-by (\"Sur la place, chacun passe\"). Mica\u00ebla appears, seeking Jos\u00e9. Moral\u00e8s tells her that \"Jos\u00e9 is not yet on duty\" and invites her to wait with them. She declines, saying she will return later. Jos\u00e9 arrives with the new guard, who is greeted and imitated by a crowd of urchins (\"Avec la garde montante\").\nAs the factory bell rings, the cigarette girls emerge and exchange banter with young men in the crowd (\"La cloche a sonn\u00e9\"). Carmen enters and sings her provocative habanera on the untameable nature of love (\"L'amour est un oiseau rebelle\"). The men plead with her to choose a lover, and after some teasing she throws a flower to Don Jos\u00e9, who thus far has been ignoring her but is now annoyed by her insolence.\nAs the women go back to the factory, Mica\u00ebla returns and gives Jos\u00e9 a letter and a kiss from his mother (\"Parle-moi de ma m\u00e8re!\"). He reads that his mother wants him to return home and marry Mica\u00ebla, who retreats in shy embarrassment on learning this. Just as Jos\u00e9 declares that he is ready to heed his mother's wishes, the women stream from the factory in great agitation. Zuniga, the officer of the guard, learns that Carmen has attacked a woman with a knife. When challenged, Carmen answers with mocking defiance (\"Tra la la... Coupe-moi, br\u00fble-moi\"); Zuniga orders Jos\u00e9 to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant. Left alone with Jos\u00e9, Carmen beguiles him with a seguidilla, in which she sings of a night of dancing and passion with her lover\u2014whoever that may be\u2014in Lillas Pastia's tavern. Confused yet mesmerised, Jos\u00e9 agrees to free her hands; as she is led away she pushes her escort to the ground and runs off laughing. Jos\u00e9 is arrested for dereliction of duty.\nAct 2\nLillas Pastia's Inn\nTwo months have passed. Carmen and her friends Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s are entertaining Zuniga and other officers (\"Les tringles des sistres tintaient\") in Pastia's inn. Carmen is delighted to learn of Jos\u00e9's release from two months' detention. Outside, a chorus and procession announces the arrival of the toreador Escamillo (\"Vivat, vivat le Tor\u00e9ro\"). Invited inside, he introduces himself with the \"Toreador Song\" (\"Votre toast, je peux vous le rendre\") and sets his sights on Carmen, who brushes him aside. Lillas Pastia hustles the crowds and the soldiers away.\nWhen only Carmen, Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s remain, smugglers Danca\u00efre and Remendado arrive and reveal their plans to dispose of some recently acquired contraband (\"Nous avons en t\u00eate une affaire\"). Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s are keen to help them, but Carmen refuses, since she wishes to wait for Jos\u00e9. After the smugglers leave, Jos\u00e9 arrives. Carmen treats him to a private exotic dance (\"Je vais danser en votre honneur ... La la la\"), but her song is joined by a distant bugle call from the barracks. When Jos\u00e9 says he must return to duty, she mocks him, and he answers by showing her the flower that she threw to him in the square (\"La fleur que tu m'avais jet\u00e9e\"). Unconvinced, Carmen demands he show his love by leaving with her. Jos\u00e9 refuses to desert, but as he prepares to depart, Zuniga enters looking for Carmen. He and Jos\u00e9 fight, and are separated by the returning smugglers, who restrain Zuniga. Having attacked a superior officer, Jos\u00e9 now has no choice but to join Carmen and the smugglers (\"Suis-nous \u00e0 travers la campagne\").\nAct 3\nA wild spot in the mountains\nCarmen and Jos\u00e9 enter with the smugglers and their booty (\"\u00c9coute, \u00e9coute, compagnons\"); Carmen has now become bored with Jos\u00e9 and tells him scornfully that he should go back to his mother. Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s amuse themselves by reading their fortunes from the cards; Carmen joins them and finds that the cards are foretelling her death, and Jos\u00e9's. The women depart to suborn the customs officers who are watching the locality. Jos\u00e9 is placed on guard duty.\nMica\u00ebla enters with a guide, seeking Jos\u00e9 and determined to rescue him from Carmen (\"Je dis que rien ne m'\u00e9pouvante\"). On hearing a gunshot she hides in fear; it is Jos\u00e9, who has fired at an intruder who proves to be Escamillo. Jos\u00e9's pleasure at meeting the bullfighter turns to anger when Escamillo declares his infatuation with Carmen. The pair fight (\"Je suis Escamillo, tor\u00e9ro de Grenade\"), but are interrupted by the returning smugglers and girls (\"Hol\u00e0, hol\u00e0 Jos\u00e9\"). As Escamillo leaves he invites everyone to his next bullfight in Seville. Mica\u00ebla is discovered; at first, Jos\u00e9 will not leave with her despite Carmen's mockery, but he agrees to go when told that his mother is dying. As he departs, vowing he will return, Escamillo is heard in the distance, singing the toreador's song.\nAct 4\nA square in Seville. At the back, the walls of an ancient amphitheatre\nZuniga, Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s are among the crowd awaiting the arrival of the bullfighters (\"Les voici ! Voici la quadrille!\"). Escamillo enters with Carmen, and they express their mutual love (\"Si tu m'aimes, Carmen\"). As Escamillo goes into the arena, Frasquita and Mercedes warn Carmen that Jos\u00e9 is nearby, but Carmen is unafraid and willing to speak to him. Alone, she is confronted by the desperate Jos\u00e9 (\"C'est toi ! C'est moi !\"). While he pleads vainly for her to return to him, cheers are heard from the arena. As Jos\u00e9 makes his last entreaty, Carmen contemptuously throws down the ring he gave her and attempts to enter the arena. He then stabs her, and as Escamillo is acclaimed by the crowds, Carmen dies. Jos\u00e9 kneels and sings \"Ah! Carmen! ma Carmen ador\u00e9e!\"; as the crowd exits the arena, Jos\u00e9 confesses to killing the woman he loved.",

        "brief": "Place: Seville, Spain, and surrounding hills\nTime: Around 1820\nAct 1\nA square, in Seville. On the right, a door to the tobacco factory. At the back, a bridge. On the left, a guardhouse.\nA group of soldiers relaxes in the square, waiting for the changing of the guard and commenting on the passers-by (\"Sur la place, chacun passe\"). Mica\u00ebla appears, seeking Jos\u00e9. Moral\u00e8s tells her that \"Jos\u00e9 is not yet on duty\" and invites her to wait with them. She declines, saying she will return later. Jos\u00e9 arrives with the new guard, who is greeted and imitated by a crowd of urchins (\"Avec la garde montante\").\nAs the factory bell rings, the cigarette girls emerge and exchange banter with young men in the crowd (\"La cloche a sonn\u00e9\"). Carmen enters and sings her provocative habanera on the untameable nature of love (\"L'amour est un oiseau rebelle\"). The men plead with her to choose a lover, and after some teasing she throws a flower to Don Jos\u00e9, who thus far has been ignoring her but is now annoyed by her insolence.\nAs the women go back to the factory, Mica\u00ebla returns and gives Jos\u00e9 a letter and a kiss from his mother (\"Parle-moi de ma m\u00e8re!\"). He reads that his mother wants him to return home and marry Mica\u00ebla, who retreats in shy embarrassment on learning this. Just as Jos\u00e9 declares that he is ready to heed his mother's wishes, the women stream from the factory in great agitation. Zuniga, the officer of the guard, learns that Carmen has attacked a woman with a knife. When challenged, Carmen answers with mocking defiance (\"Tra la la... Coupe-moi, br\u00fble-moi\"); Zuniga orders Jos\u00e9 to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant. Left alone with Jos\u00e9, Carmen beguiles him with a seguidilla, in which she sings of a night of dancing and passion with her lover\u2014whoever that may be\u2014in Lillas Pastia's tavern. Confused yet mesmerised, Jos\u00e9 agrees to free her hands; as she is led away she pushes her escort to the ground and runs off laughing. Jos\u00e9 is arrested for dereliction of duty.\nAct 2\nLillas Pastia's Inn\nTwo months have passed. Carmen and her friends Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s are entertaining Zuniga and other officers (\"Les tringles des sistres tintaient\") in Pastia's inn. Carmen is delighted to learn of Jos\u00e9's release from two months' detention. Outside, a chorus and procession announces the arrival of the toreador Escamillo (\"Vivat, vivat le Tor\u00e9ro\"). Invited inside, he introduces himself with the \"Toreador Song\" (\"Votre toast, je peux vous le rendre\") and sets his sights on Carmen, who brushes him aside. Lillas Pastia hustles the crowds and the soldiers away.\nWhen only Carmen, Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s remain, smugglers Danca\u00efre and Remendado arrive and reveal their plans to dispose of some recently acquired contraband (\"Nous avons en t\u00eate une affaire\"). Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s are keen to help them, but Carmen refuses, since she wishes to wait for Jos\u00e9. After the smugglers leave, Jos\u00e9 arrives. Carmen treats him to a private exotic dance (\"Je vais danser en votre honneur ... La la la\"), but her song is joined by a distant bugle call from the barracks. When Jos\u00e9 says he must return to duty, she mocks him, and he answers by showing her the flower that she threw to him in the square (\"La fleur que tu m'avais jet\u00e9e\"). Unconvinced, Carmen demands he show his love by leaving with her. Jos\u00e9 refuses to desert, but as he prepares to depart, Zuniga enters looking for Carmen. He and Jos\u00e9 fight, and are separated by the returning smugglers, who restrain Zuniga. Having attacked a superior officer, Jos\u00e9 now has no choice but to join Carmen and the smugglers (\"Suis-nous \u00e0 travers la campagne\").\nAct 3\nA wild spot in the mountains\nCarmen and Jos\u00e9 enter with the smugglers and their booty (\"\u00c9coute, \u00e9coute, compagnons\"); Carmen has now become bored with Jos\u00e9 and tells him scornfully that he should go back to his mother. Frasquita and Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s amuse themselves by reading their fortunes from the cards; Carmen joins them and finds that the cards are foretelling her death, and Jos\u00e9's. The women depart to suborn the customs officers who are watching the locality. Jos\u00e9 is placed on guard duty.\nMica\u00ebla enters with a guide, seeking Jos\u00e9 and determined to rescue him from Carmen (\"Je dis que rien ne m'\u00e9pouvante\"). On hearing a gunshot she hides in fear; it is Jos\u00e9, who has fired at an intruder who proves to be Escamillo. Jos\u00e9's pleasure at meeting the bullfighter turns to anger when Escamillo declares his infatuation with Carmen. The pair fight (\"Je suis Escamillo, tor\u00e9ro de Grenade\"), but are interrupted by the returning smugglers and girls (\"Hol\u00e0, hol\u00e0 Jos\u00e9\"). As Escamillo leaves he invites everyone to his next bullfight in Seville. Mica\u00ebla is discovered; at first, Jos\u00e9 will not leave with her despite Carmen's mockery, but he agrees to go when told that his mother is dying. As he departs, vowing he will return, Escamillo is heard in the distance, singing the toreador's song.\nAct 4\nA square in Seville.

Titans are typically several stories tall, seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls, even taller than the biggest Titans. Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a Titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a Colossal Titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller Titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren vows that he will murder every single Titan and take revenge for all of mankind."

Una piccola percentuale dell'umanit\u00e0 per\u00f2 sopravvisse asserragliandosi in una citt\u00e0 circondata da mura estremamente alte, anche pi\u00f9 alte del pi\u00f9 grande di giganti.

Ma presto un orrore indicibile si palesa alle sue porte, ed un gigante pi\u00f9 grande di quanto si sia mai sentito narrare, appare dal nulla abbattendo le mura ed imperversando assieme ad altri suoi simili fra la popolazione. Eren, vinto il terrore iniziale, si ripromette di eliminare ogni singolo gigante, per vendicare l'umanit\u00e0 tutta."

Ihr Name ist Celestial Being und sie verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber \"Gundam\" Mobile Suits. Mit diesen intervenieren sie allen m\u00f6glichen Kriegsakten."
