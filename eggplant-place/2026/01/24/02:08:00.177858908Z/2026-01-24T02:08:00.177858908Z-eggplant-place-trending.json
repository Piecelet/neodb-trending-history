        "description": "O trabalho de Drauzio Varella como m\u00e9dico volunt\u00e1rio em penitenci\u00e1rias come\u00e7ou em 1989, na extinta Casa de Deten\u00e7\u00e3o de S\u00e3o Paulo, o Carandiru. Os anos de cl\u00ednica e as hist\u00f3rias dos presos, dos funcion\u00e1rios e da pr\u00f3pria cadeia seriam retratados nos aclamados livros Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Carandiru (1999) e Carcereiros (2012). Em 2017, Drauzio encerra sua trilogia liter\u00e1ria sobre o sistema carcer\u00e1rio brasileiro com Prisioneiras. Al\u00e7ando as mulheres encarceradas a protagonistas, o m\u00e9dico rememora os \u00faltimos onze anos de atendimento na Penitenci\u00e1ria Feminina da Capital, que abriga mais de duas mil detentas. S\u00e3o hist\u00f3rias de mulheres que n\u00e3o raro entram para o crime por conta de seus parceiros - inclusive tentando levar drogas aos companheiros nas penitenci\u00e1rias masculinas em dias de visita -, mas que s\u00e3o esquecidas quando est\u00e3o atr\u00e1s das grades. As fam\u00edlias conseguem tolerar um encarcerado, mas n\u00e3o uma m\u00e3e, irm\u00e3, filha ou esposa na cadeia.

But they also bring peace to two unhappy Muscovites: one is the Master, a writer pilloried for daring to write a novel about Christ and Pontius Pilate; the other is Margarita, who loves the Master so deeply that she is willing literally to go to hell for him.

This is the story of us.\u201d \u2013 Slate\n\n\u201cEarnest and empathetic.\u201d \u2013 The New York Times\n\nTuberculosis has been entwined with humanity for millennia. Once romanticized as a malady of poets, today tuberculosis is seen as a disease of poverty that walks the trails of injustice and inequity we blazed for it.\n\nIn 2019, author John Green met Henry Reider, a young tuberculosis patient at Lakka Government Hospital in Sierra Leone. John became fast friends with Henry, a boy with spindly legs and a big, goofy smile. In the years since that first visit to Lakka, Green has become a vocal advocate for increased access to treatment and wider awareness of the healthcare inequities that allow this curable, preventable infectious disease to also be the deadliest, killing over a million people every year.\n\nIn Everything Is Tuberculosis, John tells Henry\u2019s story, woven through with the scientific and social histories of how tuberculosis has shaped our world\u2014and how our choices will shape the future of tuberculosis.",

Neste romance, narrado em primeira pessoa, Lestat d\u00e1 a sua vers\u00e3o dos fatos relatados na c\u00e9lebre entrevista e conta sua fascinante hist\u00f3ria, desde que era um simples mortal no interior da Fran\u00e7a pr\u00e9-revolucion\u00e1ria.\n\n Para escapar da rotina da vida no campo, o jovem Lestat de Lioncourt, seduzido pela fulgurante Paris do s\u00e9culo XVIII, abandona sua fam\u00edlia e segue com uma trupe de atores para trabalhar no teatro. Em Paris, seu talento chama a aten\u00e7\u00e3o de Magnus, um vampiro secular que est\u00e1 decidido a dar fim \u00e0 pr\u00f3pria exist\u00eancia, e, para isso, transforma Lestat em vampiro, legando a ele sua fortuna e a miss\u00e3o de encontrar as origens de sua esp\u00e9cie.\n\n Em sua busca, Lestat desvela a fant\u00e1stica mitologia vampiresca que remonta ao antigo Egito e, aos poucos, toma conhecimento de quem \u00e9 quem na galeria de imortais que habitam os subterr\u00e2neos do mundo. Suas aventuras atrav\u00e9s dos tempos desembocam no s\u00e9culo XX, quando o vampiro se torna um \u00eddolo do rock, com uma verdadeira legi\u00e3o de f\u00e3s e clipes na MTV. Al\u00e9m de se integrar ao mundo dos vivos com sua m\u00fasica, Lestat pretende acordar vampiros ancestrais para tentar esclarecer os enigmas de sua misteriosa forma de exist\u00eancia.\n\n Com essa extravag\u00e2ncia, no entanto, Lestat acaba quebrando o c\u00f3digo de sil\u00eancio dos vampiros e provocando a ira de criaturas ainda mais poderosas do que ele. Assim, perseguido pelos imortais e pelos mortais que percebem sua natureza, Lestat percorre o mundo, experimentando os pesares, mas tamb\u00e9m todos os prazeres que a condi\u00e7\u00e3o de vampiro pode lhe proporcionar.

We follow him through public school and Cambridge, and on into his father's firm, Hill and Hall, Stock Brokers. In a highly structured society, Maurice is a conventional young man in almost every way, \"stepping into the niche that England had prepared for him\": except that his is homosexual. Written during 1913 and 1914, immediately after \"Howards End,\" and not published until 1971, \" Maurice\" was ahead of its time in its theme and in its affirmation that love between men can be happy. \"Happiness,\" Forster wrote, \"is its keynote. In \"Maurice\" I tried to create a character who was completely unlike myself or what I supposed myself to be: someone handsome, healthy, bodily attractive, mentally torpid, not a bad businessman and rather a snob. Into this mixture I dropped an ingredient that puzzles him, wakes him up, torments him and finally saves him.\"\n\u6ce8\uff1a\u8be5\u4e66\u67093\u4e2a\u5c01\u9762\u5185\u5bb9\u5b8c\u5168\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8d27\u54c1\u968f\u673a\u53d1\u9001"

Tanto trabalho tem logo a sua recompensa: o single de estreia emplacou o primeiro lugar no ranking das m\u00fasicas mais ouvidas e teve uma vendagem recorde logo na primeira semana.\n Isso tira o Tranes do seu reinado. Com a popularidade de Nana em ascens\u00e3o, Reira come\u00e7a a ouvir cr\u00edticas nada favor\u00e1veis por parte do p\u00fablico. Para se distrair um pouco, ela decide visitar Ren, e juntos, resolvem dar um passeio na cidade onde deu origem \u00e0 banda. O que eles n\u00e3o imaginavam \u00e9 que estavam sendo seguidos por um paparazzo.\n Enquanto isso, Hachiko e Takumi passam o dia \u00e0 toa juntos em casa. Esse mesmo dia seria a data do t\u00e3o aguardado casamento, que foi adiado. Mesmo assim, Nana-chan \u00e9 compreensiva e o tempo transcorreu tranquilamente.\n Por\u00e9m, uma bomba que ir\u00e1 abalar a todos est\u00e1 prestes a explodir.",

Professor Dumbledore has given them clues about what they need to do to defeat the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort, once and for all, but it's up to them to figure out what these hints and suggestions really mean. Their cross-country odyssey has them searching desperately for the answers, while evading capture or death at every turn. At the same time, their friendship, fortitude, and sense of right and wrong are tested in ways they never could have imagined. The ultimate battle between good and evil that closes out this final chapter of the epic series takes place where Harry's Wizarding life began: at Hogwarts. The satisfying conclusion offers shocking last-minute twists, incredible acts of courage, powerful new forms of magic, and the resolution of many mysteries. Above all, this intense, cathartic book serves as a clear statement of the message at the heart of the Harry Potter series: that choice matters much more than destiny, and that love will always triumph over death.\n \n Series Information: Eleven-year-old Harry Potter is an orphan living with his cruel aunt and uncle when he makes a discovery that will change his life forever: he is a wizard. He is whisked away to the mystical Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magical skills, from potions to spells to flying on broomsticks. But an evil power is rising, the same one that threatened to destroy the entire world when Harry was only a baby. As Harry learns the truth about his family, his childhood, and his mysterious lightning-bolt-shaped scar, he finds unforgettable friendship, a loving surrogate family, and the courage to face the darkest force ever to menace the wizarding world. These charming and engrossing books bring an intensely detailed and captivating world to life and are perfect for enjoying individually or reading aloud."

            "text": " RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller.  Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.\n \n  You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. \n   Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions.\n   Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more.\n   Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.\n   Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others.\n   Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines.\n   Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials.\n   Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.\n   Trade with passing ships and caravans.\n   Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony.\n   Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.\n   Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.\n   Discover a new generated world each time you play.\n   Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop.\n   Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.  \n  RimWorld is a story generator.  It\u2019s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the \u201crandom\u201d events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the  AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.\n \n  Your colonists are not professional settlers  \u2013 they\u2019re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You\u2019ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.\n \n  Each person\u2019s background is tracked and affects how they play.  A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \u2013 but he does that very well.\n \n  Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.  Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.\n \n  The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.  You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.\n \n  Travel across the planet.  You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.\n \n  You can tame and train animals.  Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.\n \n  People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.  They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.\n \n  Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.  Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.\n \n  You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.  A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.\n \n And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active modding community on the Steam Workshop."

Est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ado para ser co-autor de historias tr\u00e1gicas, alocadas y llenas de triunfos, relatando la vida de piratas, colonos desesperados, gente muriendo de hambre y supervivencia  IA Narradora . Hay varios narradores a elegir. Randy Random hace cosas locas, Cassandra Classic prefiere que vaya subiendo la tensi\u00f3n poco a poco, y Phoebe Chillax prefiere relajarse.\n \n  Tus colonos no son colonizadores expertos  - son supervivientes de una cat\u00e1strofe, cuando se encontraban en un transbordador de pasajeros que fue destruido en \u00f3rbita. Podr\u00edas terminar con un noble, un contable, y una ama de casa. Obtendr\u00e1s m\u00e1s colonos al capturarlos en combate y convertirlos a tu facci\u00f3n, comprarlos de comerciantes de esclavos, o simplemente al aceptar refugiados. As\u00ed que tu colonia siempre ser\u00e1 un equipo variopinto.\n \n  Los antecedentes de la persona ser\u00e1n registrados y esto afectar\u00e1 la forma en que se juegan.  Un noble ser\u00e1 perfecto para situaciones sociales (reclutando prisioneros, negociando precios con comerciantes), pero se negar\u00e1 a hacer trabajo f\u00edsico. Un granjero sabr\u00e1 como cosechar alimento para esas largas temporadas, pero no es bueno investigando. Un cient\u00edfico ser\u00e1 un excelente investigador, pero no cuenta con habilidades sociales. Un asesino gen\u00e9ticamente modificado s\u00f3lo sabr\u00e1 matar - pero al menos ser\u00e1 muy bueno en esto.\n \n  Los colonos desarrollar\u00e1n - y destruir\u00e1n - relaciones.  Cada uno tiene una opini\u00f3n distinta de los dem\u00e1s, lo que determina si se har\u00e1n amantes, se casar\u00e1n, habr\u00e1 enga\u00f1os, o pelear\u00e1n. Quiz\u00e1s tus mejores dos colonos se encuentren felizmente casados - hasta que ella se enamore de ese atractivo cirujano que la salv\u00f3 de una herida de bala.\n \n  El juego genera un nuevo planeta del polo al ecuador.  Puedes elegir si aterrizar tus c\u00e1psulas de escape en una fr\u00eda tundra al norte, una planicie en el desierto, un bosque templado, o una c\u00e1lida jungla en el ecuador. Cada \u00e1rea cuenta con animales, plantas, enfermedades, temperaturas, lluvias, recursos minerales y terrenos distintos. Los retos para sobrevivir en una jungla caliente llena de enfermedades son muy distintos a estar en un desierto \u00e1rido o una tundra congelada con una temporada de cosecha de tan s\u00f3lo dos meses.\n \n  Recorre todo el planeta.  No tienes porqu\u00e9 quedarte atrapado en un s\u00f3lo lugar. Podr\u00e1s formar caravanas de personas, animales y prisioneros. Rescatar antiguos aliados que han sido secuestrados por piratas, podr\u00e1s asistir a acuerdos de paz, comerciar con otras facciones, atacar colonias enemigas, y completar otras misiones.

Las mascotas adorables pondr\u00e1n de mejor humor a los colonos. Los animales de granja podr\u00e1n trabajar, podr\u00e1s orde\u00f1arlos y esquilarlos. Las bestias de ataque pueden ser liberadas contra enemigos. Hay muchos animales - gatos, labradores retrievers, osos grizzly, camellos, pumas, chinchillas, gallinas y ex\u00f3ticas formas de vida alien\u00edgenas.\n \n  La gente en RimWorld observa constantemente su situaci\u00f3n y alrededores para poder decidir c\u00f3mo sentirse en dadas circunstancias.  Ellos responden al hambre y fatiga, presenciar una muerte, cuerpos sin vida profanados, ser heridos, estar en total oscuridad, estar dentro de lugares muy estrechos, dormir afuera o en el mismo lugar que otros, y muchas otras situaciones. Si est\u00e1n muy estresados, podr\u00edan ponerse en tu contra o colapsar.\n \n  Las lesiones, infecciones, pr\u00f3tesis, y condiciones cr\u00f3nicas son registradas en cada parte del cuerpo, y \u00e9stas podr\u00edan afectar las capacidades del personaje.  Las lesiones en los ojos podr\u00edan hacer que sea dif\u00edcil disparar o llevar a cabo una cirug\u00eda. Las piernas heridas har\u00e1n que la gente vaya m\u00e1s lento. Las manos, cerebro, boca, coraz\u00f3n, h\u00edgado, ri\u00f1ones, est\u00f3mago, pies, dedos, y muchas otras cosas m\u00e1s, pueden ser lesionadas, infectadas o ser amputadas, y todas tendr\u00e1n un efecto l\u00f3gico dentro del juego. Y otras especies tienen su propia estructura corporal - si le retiras la pata a un venado, \u00e9ste podr\u00e1 seguir caminando con las otras tres. Remueve el cuerno de un rinoceronte, y ser\u00e1 menos peligroso.\n \n  Puedes reparar partes del cuerpo con pr\u00f3tesis, que van desde las m\u00e1s primitivas a las trascendentales.  Una pata de palo ser\u00e1 suficiente para que el Colono Joe pueda volver a caminar despu\u00e9s de sufrir un terrible accidente con un rinoceronte, pero a\u00fan as\u00ed caminar\u00e1 muy lento. Compra una costosa pierna bi\u00f3nica de un comerciante al a\u00f1o siguiente, y el Colono Joe podr\u00e1 correr como un s\u00faper humano. Incluso podr\u00e1s extraer, vender, comprar y trasplantar \u00f3rganos internos.\n \n \u00a1Y hay mucho m\u00e1s que esto! El juego es f\u00e1cil de modificar y tiene una comunidad de mods muy activa. Lee m\u00e1s en .\n \n (Todas las traducciones que no est\u00e9n en ingl\u00e9s han sido hechas por fans.)"

Apprenez \u00e0 jouer facilement avec l\u2019aide d\u2019un mentor IA intelligent et discret.\n \n RimWorld est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par Tynan Sylvester et Ludeon Studios, et nous avons toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 en cours d\u2019am\u00e9liorations depuis le premier lancement public le 4 novembre 2013. Le raconteur IA \n  RimWorld n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour \u00eatre un jeu de strat\u00e9gie comp\u00e9titif, mais pour \u00eatre un g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur d\u2019histoires.  Le but n\u2019est pas de gagner ou de perdre, le but est le drame, les trag\u00e9dies, et la com\u00e9die qui se d\u00e9roulent dans la colonie. Le jeu cr\u00e9e des \u00e9v\u00e8nements comme des incursions de pirates, l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de marchands, et les temp\u00eates. Cependant, ces \u00e9v\u00e8nements ne sont pas al\u00e9atoires. RimWorld utilise le raconteur IA (inspir\u00e9 par le directeur IA de Left 4 Dead) qui analyse votre situation et d\u00e9cide quel \u00e9v\u00e8nement produira la meilleure histoire.\n \n Il y a trois raconteurs desquels vous pouvez choisir : le rythme mod\u00e9r\u00e9 de Cassandra Classic, le rythme plus lent, et appropri\u00e9 pour la construction, de Phoebe Chillax, et l\u2019impr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 totale de Randy Random. Une dr\u00f4le de bande \n  Dans RimWorld, vos colons ne sont pas des colonisateurs professionnels  \u2013 ils sont les survivants d\u2019un \u00e9crasement de vaisseau spatial. Ils seront des comptables, des femmes de foyer, des journalistes, des cuisiniers, des nobles, des va-nu-pieds, ou des soldats.\n \n Un noble aura des habilet\u00e9s sociales excellentes (pour le recrutement des prisonniers ou la n\u00e9gociation des prix de commerce), mais il refusera tout travail physique. Le lourdaud sait comment produire la nourriture, mais il ne peut faire de la recherche. Un scientifique est ais\u00e9 \u00e0 la recherche, mais il ne pourra entreprendre aucune t\u00e2che sociale. Un assassin modifi\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9tiquement peut seulement tuer, mais il fait ceci tr\u00e8s bien.\n \n  Chaque personnage a des traits de personnalit\u00e9.  Les colons n\u00e9vros\u00e9s travaillent plus rapidement, mais ils sont plus stress\u00e9s et pr\u00e9dispos\u00e9s aux crises de nerfs. Les personnages abrasifs interagiront nuisiblement et endommageront l\u2019humeur des autres. Un nudiste aime \u00eatre nu et un cannibale devient surexcit\u00e9 lors de la consommation de la chaire humaine.\n \n  Vous obtiendrez plus de colons  en acceptant des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, en capturant des personnes au combat pour les recruter \u00e0 votre cause, en les achetant par des marchands d\u2019esclaves, en les sauvant, ou en acceptant les migrants. Mod\u00e9lisation de la sant\u00e9 \n  Les blessures, les infections, les proth\u00e8ses, et les conditions chroniques de chaque partie du corps de chaque personnage sont suivies et ont un impact sur leurs capacit\u00e9s.  Une blessure \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153il rend le tire de pr\u00e9cision et les chirurgies plus difficiles. Les mains, le cerveau, la bouche, le c\u0153ur, le foie, les reins, l\u2019estomac, les pieds, les doigts, les orteils, et plus peuvent \u00eatre bless\u00e9s, malades ou manquants, et ils auront tous un impact logique sur le fonctionnement du personnage. Les autres esp\u00e8ces auront des dispositions corporelles diff\u00e9rentes. Enlevez la patte d\u2019un chevreuil et il peut encore courir avec les trois autres!\n \n  Vous pouvez r\u00e9parer les parties du corps avec des proth\u00e8ses allant de primitif \u00e0 transcendant.  Une jambe de bois permettra \u00e0 Jean Colon de marcher suite \u00e0 un incident malheureux avec un rhinoc\u00e9ros, mais il demeurera assez lent. Achetez une jambe bionique co\u00fbteuse d\u2019un marchand la prochaine ann\u00e9e, et Jean devient un coureur d\u2019une vitesse surhumaine. Vous pouvez m\u00eame extraire, vendre, acheter, et greffer les organes. \n \n Les maladies sont une menace s\u00e9rieuse. Les lac\u00e9rations ouvertes deviendront infect\u00e9es. La grippe et la peste peuvent appara\u00eetre n\u2019importe o\u00f9, mais la malaria et la maladie du sommeil sont seulement retrouv\u00e9es dans les for\u00eats tropicales. Lorsque les colons vieillissent, ils peuvent d\u00e9velopper des conditions chroniques telles que des cataractes ou des maux de dos. La temp\u00e9rature et les saisons \n  La temp\u00e9rature est model\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des b\u00e2timents aussi bien qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur.  Avec la progression des saisons, la temp\u00e9rature \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur augmentera et diminuera. Les plantes peuvent seulement cro\u00eetre pendant certaines temp\u00e9ratures. Quand il deviendra froid, il neigera. Les personnages pourront d\u00e9velopper l\u2019hypothermie ou ils peuvent avoir un coup de chaleur.\n \n Vous pouvez contr\u00f4ler les temp\u00e9ratures \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des abris avec du chauffage ou de l\u2019air climatis\u00e9 pour faciliter la survie, le confort, ou pr\u00e9venir la d\u00e9composition de la nourriture. Vous pouvez m\u00eame fabriquer des pi\u00e8ges de temp\u00e9ratures mortellement chaudes pour cuire vos ennemis vivants. G\u00e9n\u00e9ration des plan\u00e8tes et biomes \n  Le jeu g\u00e9n\u00e8re une plan\u00e8te au complet, des p\u00f4les \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quateur.  Vous pouvez choisir d\u2019atterrir votre capsule de sauvetage sur une toundra nordique froide, une plaine d\u00e9sertique assoiff\u00e9e, une for\u00eat temp\u00e9r\u00e9e, ou une jungle \u00e9quatoriale \u00e9touffante. \n \n  Les r\u00e9gions diff\u00e9rentes ont des animaux, des plantes, des maladies, des temp\u00e9ratures, des niveaux de pr\u00e9cipitation, des min\u00e9raux, et des terrains diff\u00e9rents.  Les d\u00e9fis pour survivre une jungle \u00e9touffante et infest\u00e9e de maladie sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rents de ceux dans la d\u00e9solation d\u2019un d\u00e9sert assoiff\u00e9e ou une toundra avec une saison agricole de deux mois. Le moteur \u00e0 tactique \n  RimWorld utilise un moteur que nous avons initialement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 pour un simulateur de combat tactique  similaire \u00e0 Jagged Alliance 2. Ceci signifie qu\u2019il a beaucoup de caract\u00e9ristiques con\u00e7ues pour rendre plus int\u00e9ressants les combats arm\u00e9s en petites \u00e9quipes. Par exemple : \n \n   Il y a un syst\u00e8me mod\u00e9lisant les diff\u00e9rents types de protection par abri lors de fusillades.\n   Il y a un algorithme nuanc\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer et rapporter la probabilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre touch\u00e9 d\u2019une balle, se basant sur la distance, le niveau d\u2019habilet\u00e9, l\u2019arme utilis\u00e9e, la luminosit\u00e9 des environs, l\u2019angle du tireur et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de l\u2019abri pris par la personne vis\u00e9e. \n   Les armes ont des statistiques assez profondes.\n   L\u2019IA planifie et ex\u00e9cute des mouvements tactiques tels que le flanquement en essayant de d\u00e9tourner la ligne de mire de l\u2019ennemi. Il utilise certains algorithmes heuristiques pour analyser le champ de bataille pour utiliser l\u2019espace efficacement. Il fonctionne avec les alli\u00e9s pour \u00e9viter de cr\u00e9er un peloton.    \n En raison de l\u2019importance de l\u2019abri et du positionnement pendant les fusillades, le combat interagit \u00e0 un niveau profond avec la disposition et la structure de la colonie. Alors vous devez r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir pour d\u00e9terminer quelles constructions seraient \u00e0 votre avantage lors des combats arm\u00e9s. De plus, il est possible de construire une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de configurations de base pour obtenir un avantage tactique maximal contre diff\u00e9rents adversaires. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le combat g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 est plus int\u00e9ressant que l\u2019\u00e9change coup pour coup auquel vous vous attendez normalement dans les jeux traditionnels de construction de base. Le syst\u00e8me d\u2019enseignement \n  Ce type de jeu peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 apprendre.  Alors, nous avons cr\u00e9\u00e9 un syst\u00e8me d\u2019enseignement adaptatif qui observe vos actions pour tenter de d\u00e9terminer quelles parties du jeu vous comprenez, et vous enseigner les parties que vous avez manqu\u00e9es. Si vous ne comprenez pas un contr\u00f4le, le jeu s\u2019en apercevra et vous aidera discr\u00e8tement. Si vous comprenez d\u00e9j\u00e0 un principe, le jeu ne vous interrompra pas. \n \n  RimWorld utilise aussi un syst\u00e8me d\u2019avertissement pour s\u2019assurer que vous ne manquez rien qui m\u00e9rite votre attention.  S\u2019il y a peu de nourriture, o\u00f9 un colon se d\u00e9cha\u00eenera sous peu, un message flottera dans le coin de l\u2019\u00e9cran pour vous aviser. La colonie ne pourra plus \u00eatre an\u00e9antie parce que vous avez manqu\u00e9 un petit d\u00e9tail. Si vous \u00eates an\u00e9anti, ce sera pour une raison compl\u00e8tement l\u00e9gitime. Psychologie \n  Les personnages de RimWorld observent \u00e0 tous moments leurs situations et leurs environnements pour d\u00e9terminer comment ils se sentent.  Ils r\u00e9agissent \u00e0 la faim et la fatigue, l\u2019observation d\u2019un d\u00e9c\u00e8s, les d\u00e9pouilles non ensevelies, aux blessures, \u00e0 la noirceur, aux pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 espace restreint, au sommeil \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur ou dans la m\u00eame pi\u00e8ce que d\u2019autres personnes, et plusieurs autres situations. Vous pouvez inspecter la psychologie d\u2019un personnage \u00e0 tous moments pour d\u00e9terminer comment il se sent et pourquoi.\n \n  Quand un colon devient trop stress\u00e9, il peut faire une crise de nerfs.  Certains abandonneront la colonie et erreront pour un certain temps. Certains partiront. Et certains, dans le style de Dwarf Fortress, certains peuvent devenir psychotiques et piqueront une crise violente et meurtri\u00e8re. L\u2019univers \n  Le gendre de RimWorld est un m\u00e9lange de la hard science-fiction le Far West.  C\u2019est un monde au bord de l\u2019espace connu, loin de la civilisation des plan\u00e8tes centrales. La plan\u00e8te est vaste et presque enti\u00e8rement vide et il n\u2019y a pas de forte autorit\u00e9 dans les environs. Vous \u00eates laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 vous d\u00e9brouiller seul. \n \n  L\u2019id\u00e9e centrale de l\u2019univers de RimWorld est la diversit\u00e9 des exp\u00e9riences humaines.  Dans ce contexte, l\u2019humanit\u00e9 est \u00e9tendue \u00e0 travers la galaxie, pourtant ils n\u2019ont aucun moyen de voyager ou communiquer plus rapidement que la lumi\u00e8re. Combinez ceci au fait que les civilisations stellaires r\u00e9gressent (en raison des guerres ou d\u2019\u00e9pid\u00e9mies) aussi souvent qu\u2019ils progressent, alors une personne voyageant entre les \u00e9toiles peut interagir avec d\u2019autres personnes \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel autre niveau de d\u00e9veloppement, des tribus pr\u00e9 agriculturales \u00e0 des dieux-machines transcendants. \n \n Vous amorcez RimWorld avec des colons qui sont \u00e0 un niveau technologique au milieu du spectre. Cependant, vous pouvez potentiellement interagir avec des personnages \u00e0 un niveau bien inf\u00e9rieur ou sup\u00e9rieur au v\u00f4tre, et aussi bien acqu\u00e9rir et utiliser leurs outils et armes. Dans RimWorld, un arc et fl\u00e8che, un fusil de chasse, un fusil \u00e0 charge pulsatile et une machine meurtri\u00e8re biom\u00e9canique peuvent tous prendre par dans une seule bagarre."

Ma\u00dfgebliche Inspirationen sind Dwarf Fortress, Firefly und Dune.\n \n  Du beginnst mit drei \u00dcberlebenden, die gerade auf einem fernen Planeten notgelandet sind. \n \n   K\u00fcmmere dich um die Stimmungen, Bed\u00fcrfnisse, Wunden, Krankheiten und Abh\u00e4ngigkeiten deiner Kolonisten.\n   Baue deine Kolonie im Wald, in der W\u00fcste, im Dschungel, in der Tundra und mehr.\n   Beobachte, wie deine Kolonisten ihre Beziehungen zu Verwandten, Liebhabern und Ehepartnern vertiefen oder beenden.\n   Ersetze verletzte Gliedma\u00dfen und Organe durch Prothesen, bionische Teile oder biologische Teile, die du von anderen Menschen entnommen hast.\n   K\u00e4mpfe gegen Piraten, St\u00e4mme, verr\u00fcckte Tiere, Rieseninsekten und antike Killermaschinen.\n   Stelle Strukturen, Waffen und Kleidung aus Metall, Holz, Stein, Stoff oder futuristischen Materialien her.\n   Z\u00e4hme und trainiere niedliche Haustiere, produktive Nutztiere oder t\u00f6dliche Bestien.\n   Handle mit vorbeiziehenden Schiffen und Karawanen.\n   Erstelle Karawanen, um Quests zu erledigen, Handel zu treiben, andere Fraktionen anzugreifen oder deine ganze Kolonie umzusiedeln.\n   Grabe dich durch Schnee, \u00fcberstehe St\u00fcrme und l\u00f6sche Br\u00e4nde.\n   Fange Fl\u00fcchtlinge oder Gefangene ein, um sie zu rekrutieren oder in die Sklaverei zu verkaufen.\n   Erkunde eine zuf\u00e4llig generierte Welt.\n   Entdecke Hunderte von wilden und interessanten Mods im Steam Workshop.\n   Lerne auf einfache Weise das Spiel kennen, dank eines intelligenten und diskreten KI-Tutors.  \n  RimWorld ist ein Geschichtengenerator.  Es wurde entwickelt, um dich bei tragischen, kuriosen und triumphalen Geschichten \u00fcber eingesperrte Piraten, verzweifelte Kolonisten, Hungersn\u00f6te und \u00dcberleben mitwirken zu lassen. Das Ganze funktioniert, indem du die \"zuf\u00e4lligen\" Ereignisse ausspielst, die dir die Welt zuwirft. Jedes Gewitter, jeder Piraten\u00fcberfall und jeder reisende H\u00e4ndler ist ein von einer  Erz\u00e4hler-KI  ausgel\u00f6stes Ereignis, das Einfluss auf deine Geschichte haben wird. Es gibt mehrere Geschichtenerz\u00e4hler, aus denen du w\u00e4hlen kannst. Randy Random macht verr\u00fcckte Sachen, Cassandra Classic l\u00e4sst die Spannung kontinuierlich ansteigen und Phoebe Chillax ist eher von der ruhigen Sorte.\n \n  Deine Kolonisten sind keine erfahrenen Siedler.  Sie sind notgelandete \u00dcberlebende eines Passagierschiffs, das in der Umlaufbahn zerst\u00f6rt wurde. Es kann passieren, dass deine Geschichte mit einem Adligen, einem Buchhalter und einer Hausfrau beginnt. Um weitere Kolonisten zu erhalten, kannst du Feinde gefangen nehmen und rekrutieren, Sklavenh\u00e4ndler aufsuchen oder Fl\u00fcchtlinge bei dir aufnehmen. Deine Kolonie wird also immer eine bunte Truppe sein.\n \n  Jede Person hat eine Vorgeschichte, die ihr Verhalten bestimmt.  Ein Adliger ist gut in sozialen Dingen (z. B. beim Anwerben von Gefangenen oder Aushandeln von Preisen), weigert sich aber, k\u00f6rperliche Arbeit zu verrichten. Ein einfacher Bauer wei\u00df aus langer Erfahrung, wie man Nahrung anbaut, kann aber nicht forschen. Ein strebsamer Wissenschaftler ist als Forscher gut geeignet, kann aber keine sozialen Aufgaben \u00fcbernehmen. Ein genmanipulierter Attent\u00e4ter t\u00f6tet einfach nur \u2014 aber mit hoher Effizienz.\n \n  Kolonisten entwickeln - und zerst\u00f6ren - Beziehungen.  Jeder hat eine Meinung \u00fcber den anderen. Dies hat Einfluss darauf, ob sie ein Paar werden, heiraten, betr\u00fcgen oder sich pr\u00fcgeln. Vielleicht sind deine beiden besten Kolonisten gl\u00fccklich verheiratet \u2014 bis sich einer von ihnen in den feschen Chirurgen verliebt, der sie oder ihn vor einer Schusswunde gerettet hat.\n \n  Das Spiel generiert einen ganzen Planeten vom Pol bis zum \u00c4quator.  Du hast die Wahl, ob das Startgebiet eine kalte Tundra im Norden, eine trockene W\u00fcstenebene, ein gem\u00e4\u00dfigter Wald oder ein schw\u00fclwarmer Dschungel am \u00c4quator sein soll. Jedes Gebiet hat andere Tiere, Pflanzen, Krankheiten, Temperaturen, Niederschl\u00e4ge, Bodensch\u00e4tze und Gel\u00e4ndeformen. Das \u00dcberleben in einem krankheitsverseuchten, erstickenden Dschungel ist eine ganz andere Erfahrung als in einer trockenen W\u00fcstenebene oder einer gefrorenen Tundra mit einer zweimonatigen Wachstumsperiode.\n \n  Reise \u00fcber den ganzen Planeten.  Du bist nicht an einen Ort gebunden. Du kannst eine Karawane mit Menschen, Tieren und Gefangenen zusammenstellen. Rette entf\u00fchrte Verb\u00fcndete aus einem Piratenau\u00dfenposten, nimm an Friedensgespr\u00e4chen teil, treibe Handel mit anderen Fraktionen, greife feindliche Kolonien an und erledige andere Quests. Du kannst sogar deine gesamte Kolonie aufl\u00f6sen und an einen neuen Ort ziehen. Nutze raketenbetriebene Transportkapseln, um die Reise zu beschleunigen.\n \n  Du kannst Tiere z\u00e4hmen und trainieren.  Niedliche Haustiere k\u00f6nnen deine traurigen Kolonisten aufmuntern. Nutztiere k\u00f6nnen geschlachtet, gemolken und geschoren werden. Kampftiere k\u00f6nnen auf deine Feinde losgelassen werden. Es gibt viele Tiere: Katzen, Labrador Retriever, Grizzlyb\u00e4ren, Kamele, Pumas, Chinchillas, H\u00fchner und exotische, fremde Lebensformen.\n \n  Die Menschen in RimWorld analysieren st\u00e4ndig ihre Situation und Umgebung, was Einfluss auf ihre momentane Gef\u00fchlslage hat.  Sie reagieren unter anderem auf Hunger und M\u00fcdigkeit, auf Todesf\u00e4lle, auf nicht beerdigte Leichen, auf Verletzungen, auf Dunkelheit, auf enge R\u00e4ume, auf \u00dcbernachtungen im Freien oder darauf, ob sie ihren Schlafraum mit jemand anderem teilen m\u00fcssen. Wenn sie zu sehr gestresst sind, k\u00f6nnen sie ausrasten oder kollabieren.\n \n  Wunden, Infektionen, Prothesen und chronische Krankheiten k\u00f6nnen an jedem K\u00f6rperteil auftreten und beeinflussen die Leistungsf\u00e4higkeit der Charaktere.  Augenverletzungen erschweren das Schie\u00dfen oder eine Operation. Verwundete Beine machen Menschen langsamer. H\u00e4nde, Gehirn, Mund, Herz, Leber, Nieren, Magen, F\u00fc\u00dfe, Finger, Zehen usw. k\u00f6nnen verletzt werden, erkranken oder fehlen \u2014 all das wird sich logisch im Spiel auswirken. Andere Spezies haben ihren eigenen K\u00f6rperbau \u2014 wenn ein Hirsch eines seiner Beine verliert, kann er immer noch auf den anderen drei humpeln. Entferne das Horn eines Nashorns, und es ist viel weniger gef\u00e4hrlich.\n \n  Du kannst K\u00f6rperteile durch Prothesen ersetzen.  Ein Holzbein sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass der arme Joe nach einem ungl\u00fccklichen Zwischenfall mit einem Nashorn wieder laufen kann, auch wenn er damit nur recht langsam vorankommt. Kaufe ein Jahr sp\u00e4ter ein teures bionisches Bein von einem H\u00e4ndler ab, um Joe zu einem \u00fcbermenschlichen L\u00e4ufer zu machen. Du kannst sogar Organe entnehmen, verkaufen, kaufen und implantieren.\n \n Und es gibt noch viel mehr als das! Das Spiel ist leicht zu modifizieren und hat eine aktive Mod-Community. Weitere Informationen findest du auf .\n \n (Alle \u00dcbersetzungen aus dem Englischen wurden von Fans erstellt.)"

Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.\n \n  You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. \n   Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions.\n   Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more.\n   Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.\n   Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others.\n   Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines.\n   Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials.\n   Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.\n   Trade with passing ships and caravans.\n   Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony.\n   Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.\n   Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.\n   Discover a new generated world each time you play.\n   Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop.\n   Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.  \n  RimWorld is a story generator.  It\u2019s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the \u201crandom\u201d events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the  AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.\n \n  Your colonists are not professional settlers  \u2013 they\u2019re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You\u2019ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.\n \n  Each person\u2019s background is tracked and affects how they play.  A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \u2013 but he does that very well.\n \n  Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.  Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.\n \n  The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.  You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.\n \n  Travel across the planet.  You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.\n \n  You can tame and train animals.  Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.\n \n  People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.  They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.\n \n  Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.  Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.\n \n  You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.  A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.\n \n And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active modding community on the Steam Workshop."

So your colony will always be a motley crew.\n \n  Each person\u2019s background is tracked and affects how they play.  A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work.

Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.\n \n  Travel across the planet.  You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.\n \n  You can tame and train animals.  Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.\n \n  People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.  They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.\n \n  Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.  Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.\n \n  You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.  A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow.

            "text": " RimWorld \u00e8 una colonia fantascientifica sim guidata da un narratore dotato di intelligenza artificiale.  Ispirato a Dwarf Fortress, Firefly e Dune.\n \n  Inizi con tre sopravvissuti di un naufragio in un mondo lontano. \n   Gestisci gli umori, i bisogni, le ferite, le malattie e le dipendenze dei coloni.\n   Costruisci nella foresta, nel deserto, nella giungla, nella tundra e altro ancora.\n   Guarda i coloni sviluppare e rompere i rapporti con familiari, amanti e coniugi.\n   Sostituisci gli arti e gli organi feriti con protesi, bionici o parti biologiche raccolte da altri.\n   Combatti pirati, trib\u00f9, animali pazzi, insetti giganti e antiche macchine per uccidere.\n   Crea strutture, armi e abbigliamento in metallo, legno, pietra, stoffa e materiali futuristici.\n   Domina e addestra simpatici animali domestici, animali da fattoria produttivi e bestie da attacco mortali.\n   Commerci con navi di passaggio e roulotte.\n   Forma roulotte per completare missioni, commerciare, attaccare altre fazioni o migrare l'intera colonia.\n   Scava attraverso la neve, i temporali e combatti gli incendi.\n   Cattura rifugiati o prigionieri e accoglili dalla tua parte o vendili come schiavi.\n   Scopri un nuovo mondo generato ogni volta che giochi.\n   Esplora centinaia di modalit\u00e0 selvagge e interessanti sullo Steam Workshop.\n   Impara a giocare facilmente con l'aiuto di un tutor dotato di intelligenza artificiale intelligente e discreto.  \n  RimWorld \u00e8 un generatore di storie.  \u00c8 progettato per co-autore di storie tragiche, contorte e trionfanti su pirati imprigionati, coloni disperati, fame e sopravvivenza. Funziona controllando gli eventi \"casuali\" che il mondo ti lancia. Ogni temporale, raid pirata e commesso viaggiatore \u00e8 una carta distribuita nella tua storia dal  narratore intelligente . Ci sono diversi narratori tra cui scegliere. Randy Random fa cose pazze, Cassandra Classic cerca di aumentare la tensione e Phoebe Chillax ama rilassarsi.\n \n  I tuoi coloni non sono coloni professionisti : sono sopravvissuti all'atterraggio di una nave passeggeri distrutta in orbita. Puoi finire con un nobile, un ragioniere e una casalinga. Acquisirai pi\u00f9 coloni catturandoli in combattimento e portandoli dalla tua parte, acquistandoli da commercianti di schiavi o accogliendo rifugiati. Quindi la tua colonia sar\u00e0 sempre una squadra eterogenea.\n \n  Il background di ogni persona viene monitorato e influenza il modo in cui gioca.  Un nobile sar\u00e0 bravo nelle abilit\u00e0 sociali (reclutamento di prigionieri, negoziazione dei prezzi commerciali), ma rifiuta di fare un lavoro fisico. Una fattoria oaf sa come coltivare il cibo con una lunga esperienza, ma non pu\u00f2 fare ricerca. Uno scienziato nerd \u00e8 bravo nella ricerca, ma non pu\u00f2 assolutamente svolgere compiti sociali. Un assassino geneticamente modificato non pu\u00f2 fare altro che uccidere, ma lo fa molto bene.\n \n  I coloni sviluppano - e distruggono - le relazioni.  Ognuno ha un'opinione degli altri, che determina se diventeranno amanti, si sposeranno, imbrogliano o combatteranno. Forse i tuoi due migliori coloni sono felicemente sposati, fino a quando uno di loro non si innamora del chirurgo che l'ha salvata da una ferita da arma da fuoco.\n \n  Il gioco genera un intero pianeta dal polo a equatore.  Scegli se seminare i tuoi baccelli all'improvviso in una fredda tundra settentrionale, un deserto arido, una foresta temperata o una giungla equatoriale fumante. Diverse aree hanno diversi animali, piante, malattie, temperature, precipitazioni, risorse minerali e terreno. Queste sfide per sopravvivere in una giungla soffocante infestata da malattie sono molto diverse da quelle in una desolata terra deserta del deserto o in una tundra ghiacciata con una stagione di crescita di due mesi.\n \n  Viaggia attraverso il pianeta.  Non sei bloccato in un posto. Puoi formare una roulotte di persone, animali e prigionieri. Salvare gli ex alleati rapiti dagli avamposti dei pirati, partecipare a colloqui di pace, commerciare con altre fazioni, attaccare colonie nemiche e completare altre missioni. Puoi persino impacchettare l'intera colonia e trasferirti in un nuovo posto. Puoi usare i pod di trasporto a razzo per viaggiare pi\u00f9 velocemente.\n \n  Puoi domare e addestrare gli animali.  Gli adorabili animali rallegreranno i coloni tristi. Gli animali della fattoria possono essere lavorati, munti e tosati. Le bestie d'attacco possono essere scagliate contro i tuoi nemici. Ci sono molti animali - gatti, labrador retriever, orsi grizzly, cammelli, puma, cincill\u00e0, galline e forme di vita esotiche simili ad alieni.\n \n  Le persone in RimWorld osservano costantemente la loro situazione e l'ambiente circostante per decidere come sentirsi in un dato momento.  Rispondono alla fame e alla fatica, assistono alla morte, ai cadaveri irrispettosamente non feriti, vengono feriti, lasciati nell'oscurit\u00e0, sono stipati in ambienti angusti, dormono fuori o nella stessa stanza degli altri e in molte altre situazioni. Se sono troppo stressati, potrebbero stare male o ribellarsi.\n \n  Ferite, infezioni, protesi e condizioni croniche vengono tracciate su ogni parte del corpo e influenzano le capacit\u00e0 dei personaggi.  Le lesioni agli occhi rendono difficile sparare o eseguire un intervento chirurgico. Le gambe ferite rallentano le persone. Mani, cervello, bocca, cuore, fegato, reni, stomaco, piedi, dita, dita dei piedi e altro possono essere tutti feriti, malati o mancanti e tutti hanno effetti logici nel gioco. E altre specie hanno il proprio corredo corporeo: togliti una zampa di cervo e pu\u00f2 ancora camminare zoppicando sulle altre tre. Togliti il \u200b\u200bcorno di un rinoceronte ed \u00e8 molto meno pericoloso.\n \n  Puoi riparare parti del corpo con protesi che vanno da primitive a trascendenti.  Una gamba di legno far\u00e0 camminare Joe Colonist dopo uno sfortunato incidente con un rinoceronte, ma sar\u00e0 comunque piuttosto lento. Acquista una costosa gamba bionica da un commerciante l'anno successivo e Joe diventa un corridore sovrumano. Puoi persino estrarre, vendere, acquistare e trapiantare organi interni.\n \n E c'\u00e8 molto di pi\u00f9! Il gioco \u00e8 facile da modificare e ha una comunit\u00e0 di moderatori attiva.. Maggiori informazioni su .\n \n (Tutte le traduzioni non inglesi sono fatte dai fan.)"

This resulted in constant fights between the two until Naoyuki dislocated Tomoya\u2019s shoulder. Unable to play on his basketball team, Tomoya began to distance himself from other people. Ever since he has had a distant relationship with his father, naturally becoming a delinquent over time.\n\nWhile on a walk to school, Tomoya meets a strange girl named Nagisa Furukawa, questioning if she likes the school at all.

He and his new classmates make their way to the gymnasium, where a demented robotic bear, calling himself Monokuma and claiming to be the school's headmaster, makes a declaration: \"You're all going to be living here from now on.

Sure, if that\u2019s your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose from!\n \n    Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN:  Share your adventures with friends both online and via LAN.

Expose the evil surrounding the Hyperion Corporation and take on the perpetrator of a universe-wide grand deception -- the nefarious Hyperion CEO, Handsome Jack. (Oh, also: he's stolen credit for the opening of the Vault.)\n \n    87 Bazillion...Everything:  In addition to the new gun system, you will lust after procedurally generated shields, grenades, Relics, class mods and much, much more. And you thought the original Borderlands had a ton of loot!\n \n    Brand new environments on Pandora:  Hunt through entirely brand new areas of Pandora that are more alive than ever!  From the arctic tundra, through the dangerous grasslands, past the mysterious corrosive caverns to beyond, you\u2019ll be surprised by the unpredictable world of Pandora at every turn!\n \n    Brand new enemies:   A whole slew of new enemies are out there to kill you in Borderlands 2. Hulking, gorilla-like Bullymongs, vicious predatory Stalkers and the Hyperion mechanical army, run by Handsome Jack, are just some of the new enemies in Borderlands 2.

Sich aufb\u00e4umende, Gorilla-\u00e4hnliche Bullymongs, b\u00f6sartige, r\u00e4uberische Stalker und die mechanische Hyperion-Armee, geleitet von Handsome Jack, sind nur ein paar der neuen Gegner in Borderlands 2.

Like its predecessor, the game is a primarily story-driven shooter with heavy stealth elements. Artyom may carry up to three weapons at a time, however bullets are scarce and valuable to the point that higher grade bullets are, in fact, the Metro's currency. When dealing with armed opponents, stealth is encouraged and it is wise to save ammunition for the many mutant creatures encountered in combat. In many situations the player can choose between straightforward shooting and stealth, also having the option for lethal or non-lethal enemy takedowns.\n\nThe game picks up after the bad ending from Metro 2033, in which Artyom delivers a devastating attack on the mysterious supernatural race known as the Dark Ones. The station-cities of the Metro struggle for power using weapons found in D6. The player follows Artyom, the main protagonist from Metro 2033, as he searches for the mysterious \"Prisoner\", the supposed \u201ckey to survival \u2013 the last light in our darkest hour\u2026\u201d",

Like its predecessor, the game is a primarily story-driven shooter with heavy stealth elements. Artyom may carry up to three weapons at a time, however bullets are scarce and valuable to the point that higher grade bullets are, in fact, the Metro's currency. When dealing with armed opponents, stealth is encouraged and it is wise to save ammunition for the many mutant creatures encountered in combat. In many situations the player can choose between straightforward shooting and stealth, also having the option for lethal or non-lethal enemy takedowns.\n\nThe game picks up after the bad ending from Metro 2033, in which Artyom delivers a devastating attack on the mysterious supernatural race known as the Dark Ones. The station-cities of the Metro struggle for power using weapons found in D6. The player follows Artyom, the main protagonist from Metro 2033, as he searches for the mysterious \"Prisoner\", the supposed \u201ckey to survival \u2013 the last light in our darkest hour\u2026\u201d"

Like its predecessor, the game is a primarily story-driven shooter with heavy stealth elements. Artyom may carry up to three weapons at a time, however bullets are scarce and valuable to the point that higher grade bullets are, in fact, the Metro's currency. When dealing with armed opponents, stealth is encouraged and it is wise to save ammunition for the many mutant creatures encountered in combat. In many situations the player can choose between straightforward shooting and stealth, also having the option for lethal or non-lethal enemy takedowns.\n\nThe game picks up after the bad ending from Metro 2033, in which Artyom delivers a devastating attack on the mysterious supernatural race known as the Dark Ones. The station-cities of the Metro struggle for power using weapons found in D6. The player follows Artyom, the main protagonist from Metro 2033, as he searches for the mysterious \"Prisoner\", the supposed \u201ckey to survival \u2013 the last light in our darkest hour\u2026\u201d",

        "description": "As Lara Croft races to save the world from a Maya apocalypse, she must become the Tomb Raider she is destined to be.\n\nIn the two months since Rise of the Tomb Raider, Lara Croft and her friend Jonah Maiava have dedicated themselves to stopping the activities of paramilitary organization Trinity. The two track a cell to Cozumel in Mexico that is led by Pedro Dominguez, the head of Trinity's High Council. Slipping inside nearby tombs being excavated by Trinity, Lara discovers a temple containing the Dagger of Chak Chel and references to a hidden city. Murals adorning the walls allude to the Silver Box of Ix Chel and warn of \"the Cleansing\", a Mayan apocalypse culminating in a permanent solar eclipse. Lara ignores the warnings and takes the Dagger to prevent Trinity from acquiring it. Dominguez catches her and reveals that by taking the Dagger, Lara has triggered the Cleansing. He takes the Dagger, intending to unite it with the Box to stop the Cleansing and use the power it grants him to remake the world in his image. Lara and Jonah escape a tsunami that destroys Cozumel and foreshadows the coming apocalypse.\nDespite growing tensions between them over her actions, Lara and Jonah pursue Dominguez into the Amazon. Their plane crashes in the Peruvian jungle during the second cataclysm\u2014a massive storm\u2014and the two find their way to Paititi, the hidden city shown in the murals. Exploring local tombs reveals that piercing the Box with the Dagger will grant the user the power of the god Kukulkan, which must be used to halt the Cleansing. Lara witnesses Trinity soldiers being slaughtered by strange humanoid monsters later identified as the Yaaxil, guardians of the Box. When Lara saves a boy named Etzli, she and Jonah are brought into Paititi by his mother Unuratu, queen of the city. Lara sees Dominguez is the leader of a cult dedicated to Kukulkan and Unuratu reveals he is her brother-in-law Amaru, who was taken by Trinity as a child and raised to complete the ritual and reshape the world in their image. Unuratu directs Lara to the Box, but Lara finds it is missing. Believing the cult already has the Box, Lara, and Unuratu attempt to steal it, but Unuratu is captured. Lara also encounters the Yaaxil and their leader Crimson Fire.\nLara infiltrates the cult's temple and overhears Amaru telling Unuratu that the Box was hidden by Andres Lopez, a missionary sent to Paititi by Trinity during the Spanish conquest of South America. Lara rescues Unuratu and realizes that Amaru does not fully understand the ritual; rather than merely imbuing Kukulkan's power, the ritual sacrifices it to stop the Cleansing. Unuratu is shot by Commander Rourke, Amaru's second in command. Before she dies, Unuratu implores Lara to complete the ritual but warns her not to let the Box influence her. Rourke attacks Lara and Jonah, who are separated as they leave Paititi to decipher the next clue. Thinking Jonah dead, Lara goes on a rampage that destroys an oil refinery and slaughters everyone there except Rourke, who escapes. She momentarily breaks down when she finds Jonah alive, but he manages to calm her, and they decipher the Box's location. Driven mad by the Box, Lopez established a mission near Paititi where he trained acolytes to complete the ritual. Lara and Jonah find a secret catacomb beneath the missiong leading to Lopez's tomb and the Box. Amaru finds them and forces Lara to surrender the Box. He admits that he ordered her father's death to prevent him from finding Paititi and revealing it to the world. Lara tries to persuade Amaru to use the ritual to benefit the world. He refuses, as the Cleansing will only affect Paititi. Amaru has used his position in Trinity to manipulate them into preventing it. He leaves Lara and Jonah to escape the third cataclysm, a massive earthquake that causes a landslide and destroys the mission.\nBack in Paititi, Lara and Jonah help the newly-crowned Etzli lead an assault on an underground temple complex at Paititi's center. They plan to disrupt Amaru's ceremony while avoiding the fourth cataclysm, a volcanic eruption threatening Paititi. Lara is forced to go on alone when Trinity cuts off Etzli's forces. She encounters the Yaaxil and Crimson Fire, convincing them to help her stop Amaru. Lara takes on the symbolic role of Ix Chel while Crimson Fire becomes Chak Chel. While the Yaaxil kill Rourke and the Trinity High Council, Lara makes it to the temple summit. She fails to stop Amaru from piercing the Box and absorbing Kukulkan's power as an eclipse blocks the sun. Lara overpowers Amaru after a lengthy battle; accepting defeat, he transfers Kukulkan's power to Lara as he dies. True to Unuratu's warning, she is tempted to use the Box to revive her parents, but instead lets Crimson Fire symbolically stab her, sacrificing Kukulkan's spirit and stopping the Cleansing. In the aftermath, Unuratu is laid to rest, and Jonah decides to take a vacation. Lara stays in Paititi to help Etzli restore the city to its former glory. A post-credits scene shows Lara planning her next adventure at Croft Manor, acknowledging that her role is not to solve the world's mysteries, but to protect them.",

The two track a cell to Cozumel in Mexico that is led by Pedro Dominguez, the head of Trinity's High Council. Slipping inside nearby tombs being excavated by Trinity, Lara discovers a temple containing the Dagger of Chak Chel and references to a hidden city. Murals adorning the walls allude to the Silver Box of Ix Chel and warn of \"the Cleansing\", a Mayan apocalypse culminating in a permanent solar eclipse. Lara ignores the warnings and takes the Dagger to prevent Trinity from acquiring it. Dominguez catches her and reveals that by taking the Dagger, Lara has triggered the Cleansing. He takes the Dagger, intending to unite it with the Box to stop the Cleansing and use the power it grants him to remake the world in his image.

        "brief": "As Lara Croft races to save the world from a Maya apocalypse, she must become the Tomb Raider she is destined to be.\n\nIn the two months since Rise of the Tomb Raider, Lara Croft and her friend Jonah Maiava have dedicated themselves to stopping the activities of paramilitary organization Trinity. The two track a cell to Cozumel in Mexico that is led by Pedro Dominguez, the head of Trinity's High Council. Slipping inside nearby tombs being excavated by Trinity, Lara discovers a temple containing the Dagger of Chak Chel and references to a hidden city. Murals adorning the walls allude to the Silver Box of Ix Chel and warn of \"the Cleansing\", a Mayan apocalypse culminating in a permanent solar eclipse. Lara ignores the warnings and takes the Dagger to prevent Trinity from acquiring it. Dominguez catches her and reveals that by taking the Dagger, Lara has triggered the Cleansing. He takes the Dagger, intending to unite it with the Box to stop the Cleansing and use the power it grants him to remake the world in his image. Lara and Jonah escape a tsunami that destroys Cozumel and foreshadows the coming apocalypse.\nDespite growing tensions between them over her actions, Lara and Jonah pursue Dominguez into the Amazon. Their plane crashes in the Peruvian jungle during the second cataclysm\u2014a massive storm\u2014and the two find their way to Paititi, the hidden city shown in the murals. Exploring local tombs reveals that piercing the Box with the Dagger will grant the user the power of the god Kukulkan, which must be used to halt the Cleansing. Lara witnesses Trinity soldiers being slaughtered by strange humanoid monsters later identified as the Yaaxil, guardians of the Box. When Lara saves a boy named Etzli, she and Jonah are brought into Paititi by his mother Unuratu, queen of the city. Lara sees Dominguez is the leader of a cult dedicated to Kukulkan and Unuratu reveals he is her brother-in-law Amaru, who was taken by Trinity as a child and raised to complete the ritual and reshape the world in their image. Unuratu directs Lara to the Box, but Lara finds it is missing. Believing the cult already has the Box, Lara, and Unuratu attempt to steal it, but Unuratu is captured. Lara also encounters the Yaaxil and their leader Crimson Fire.\nLara infiltrates the cult's temple and overhears Amaru telling Unuratu that the Box was hidden by Andres Lopez, a missionary sent to Paititi by Trinity during the Spanish conquest of South America. Lara rescues Unuratu and realizes that Amaru does not fully understand the ritual; rather than merely imbuing Kukulkan's power, the ritual sacrifices it to stop the Cleansing. Unuratu is shot by Commander Rourke, Amaru's second in command. Before she dies, Unuratu implores Lara to complete the ritual but warns her not to let the Box influence her. Rourke attacks Lara and Jonah, who are separated as they leave Paititi to decipher the next clue. Thinking Jonah dead, Lara goes on a rampage that destroys an oil refinery and slaughters everyone there except Rourke, who escapes. She momentarily breaks down when she finds Jonah alive, but he manages to calm her, and they decipher the Box's location. Driven mad by the Box, Lopez established a mission near Paititi where he trained acolytes to complete the ritual. Lara and Jonah find a secret catacomb beneath the missiong leading to Lopez's tomb and the Box. Amaru finds them and forces Lara to surrender the Box. He admits that he ordered her father's death to prevent him from finding Paititi and revealing it to the world. Lara tries to persuade Amaru to use the ritual to benefit the world. He refuses, as the Cleansing will only affect Paititi. Amaru has used his position in Trinity to manipulate them into preventing it. He leaves Lara and Jonah to escape the third cataclysm, a massive earthquake that causes a landslide and destroys the mission.\nBack in Paititi, Lara and Jonah help the newly-crowned Etzli lead an assault on an underground temple complex at Paititi's center. They plan to disrupt Amaru's ceremony while avoiding the fourth cataclysm, a volcanic eruption threatening Paititi. Lara is forced to go on alone when Trinity cuts off Etzli's forces. She encounters the Yaaxil and Crimson Fire, convincing them to help her stop Amaru. Lara takes on the symbolic role of Ix Chel while Crimson Fire becomes Chak Chel. While the Yaaxil kill Rourke and the Trinity High Council, Lara makes it to the temple summit. She fails to stop Amaru from piercing the Box and absorbing Kukulkan's power as an eclipse blocks the sun. Lara overpowers Amaru after a lengthy battle; accepting defeat, he transfers Kukulkan's power to Lara as he dies. True to Unuratu's warning, she is tempted to use the Box to revive her parents, but instead lets Crimson Fire symbolically stab her, sacrificing Kukulkan's spirit and stopping the Cleansing. In the aftermath, Unuratu is laid to rest, and Jonah decides to take a vacation. Lara stays in Paititi to help Etzli restore the city to its former glory. A post-credits scene shows Lara planning her next adventure at Croft Manor, acknowledging that her role is not to solve the world's mysteries, but to protect them.",

            "text": "Anno 2013. Il pianeta viene devastato da un evento apocalittico che quasi annienta l'intero genere umano, tramutando la superficie terrestre in una landa deserta e avvelenata. Alcuni sopravvissuti, tuttavia, riescono a rifugiarsi nelle profondit\u00e0 della Metropolitana di Mosca. La civilt\u00e0 umana piomba cos\u00ec in un nuovo Medioevo.\n \n Anno 2033. Un'intera generazione \u00e8 nata e cresciuta nelle profondit\u00e0 del sottosuolo. Le nuove citt\u00e0, sorte intorno alle stazioni della Metropolitana, lottano per la sopravvivenza, combattendo tra di loro e contro gli orrori mutanti del mondo esterno.\n \n Tu sei Artyom, nato qualche giorno prima del disastro, ma cresciuto nei meandri del mondo sotterraneo. Dopo una vita interamente trascorsa entro i confini della citt\u00e0, un tragico evento ti spinger\u00e0 a intraprendere una missione disperata nel cuore del sistema metropolitano, per avvertire gli altri sopravvissuti di una nuova, incombente minaccia.\n \n Nel corso della tua avventura visiterai luoghi che mai avresti immaginato, dalle catacombe dimenticate sotto la metropolitana alle lande desolate in superficie. Il destino dell'umanit\u00e0 intera \u00e8 ora nelle tue mani.\n \n Ma se la vera minaccia... provenisse dall'interno?

Tra le numerose novit\u00e0, l'ottimizzazione dell'IA, dei comandi, delle animazioni e della gestione delle armi, che garantiscono un'esperienza elettrizzante sia per i veterani, sia per i nuovi arrivati.\n \n Alla luce dei due distinti stili di gioco e della leggendaria modalit\u00e0 Ranger inclusi nell'offerta, Metro 2033 Redux garantisce ore di intrattenimento a un prezzo incredibile.

        "brief": "Grand Theft Auto IV is an action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\n\nThe game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.\n\nTwo expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.\n\nGrand Theft Auto IV follows the story of Niko Bellic, a veteran of an unnamed war in Eastern Europe, who is haunted by the betrayal of his 15 man army unit. Ten years later, after a smuggling run goes bad due to a betrayal from a partner, Niko leaves Eastern Europe to escape the anger of his employer, Ray Bulgarin. After six months in the merchant navy (serving aboard the cargo ship the Platypus), and believing the stories of his cousin Roman, Niko comes to Liberty City to pursue the American Dream as well as searching for the traitor of his unit. After his arrival, however, Niko quickly learns that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loansharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion.",

The Game builds upon cooperatively focused gameplay and Valve's proprietary Source engine, the same game engine used in the original Left 4 Dead. Set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, Left 4 Dead 2 focuses on four new Survivors, fighting against hordes of the Infected, who develop severe psychosis and exhibit zombie-like tendencies. The Survivors must fight their way through five campaigns, interspersed with safe houses that act as checkpoints, with the goal of escape at each campaign's finale.",

COS'\u00c8 CHE CI RENDE UMANI?    \n Detroit, 2038. La tecnologia si \u00e8 evoluta a tal punto che gli androidi umanoidi sono ovunque. Parlano, si muovono e si comportano come persone, ma sono solo macchine al servizio degli esseri umani.\n Controlla tre diversi androidi e osserva coi loro occhi un mondo a un passo dal caos... forse, il nostro stesso futuro. Saranno le tue decisioni ad alterare il corso degli eventi e a governare la storia attraverso le complesse ramificazioni della trama.\n Affronterai dilemmi morali e stabilirai chi vive e chi muore. Con migliaia di scelte e decine di finali possibili, come influirai sul futuro di Detroit e il destino dell'umanit\u00e0?\n     PRENDI PARTE A UNA STORIA COINVOLGENTE Entra in un universo in cui dilemmi morali e decisioni difficili possono trasformare degli schiavi androidi in rivoluzionari destinati a cambiare il mondo. Scopri cosa significa essere umani da una prospettiva esterna e guarda il mondo attraverso gli occhi di una macchina. LE LORO VITE, LE TUE SCELTE  Fatti strada attraverso un'ambiziosa struttura narrativa ramificata, in cui le tue decisioni non determinano solo il fato dei tre protagonisti, ma di tutta la citt\u00e0 di Detroit. Il modo in cui controllerai Kara, Connor e Markus far\u00e0 la differenza tra la vita e la morte. E se uno di loro la pagher\u00e0 a caro prezzo, la storia andr\u00e0 comunque avanti... INFINITE POSSIBILIT\u00c0, INFINITI FINALI  Ogni scelta che fai, per quanto piccola, influenza l'esito della storia. Nessuna partita sar\u00e0 esattamente uguale a un'altra: gioca pi\u00f9 e pi\u00f9 volte per arrivare a conclusioni totalmente differenti. OTTIMIZZATO PER PC  Detroit: Become Human ha una straordinaria grafica con risoluzione in 4K, frame rate di 60 FPS e integrazione completa di mouse/tastiera e gamepad per immergersi totalmente nell'esperienza di Detroit: Become Human.\n       "

Roam surroundings high and low, defend against unforeseen threats and solve the mysteries of this unwelcoming place inhabited by curious droids and dangerous creatures. \n  \nSee the world through the eyes of a cat and interact with the environment in playful ways. Be stealthy, nimble, silly, and sometimes as annoying as possible with the strange inhabitants of this mysterious world. \n \nAlong the way, the cat befriends a small flying drone, known only as B-12. With the help of this newfound companion, the duo must find a way out. \n \nStray is developed by BlueTwelve Studio, a small team from the south of France mostly made up of cats and a handful of humans.",

According to The Final Hours of Portal 2, the year is established to be \"somewhere in 2010\"\u2014twelve years after Aperture Science has been abandoned.\n\nThe game begins with Chell waking up from a stasis bed and hearing instructions and warnings from GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence, about upcoming tests. Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person.[4] Chell is promised cake as her reward if she completes all test chambers.[19]\n\nChell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister; although she is designed to appear encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, tests including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the test. However, GLaDOS declares it must be euthanized in an \"emergency intelligence incinerator\" before Chell can continue.[17] Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled.[20][21]\n\nAfter Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center.[22] GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the \"party escort submission position\", lying face-first on the ground, so that a \"party associate\" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues her escape. In this section, GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center.[11][12] Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem \"The Chariot\", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and Emily Bront\u00eb's \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.[4]\n\nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas. With it removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally, with taunts and juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. Following the announcement of Portal 2, the ending was expanded in a later update. In this retroactive continuity, Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the \"party escort submission position\".[15][23]\n\nThe final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a Black Forest cake,[24] and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. The cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, causing the room to blackout.[25] As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song \"Still Alive\", which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive,[26] that her \"happy\" core was not disabled."

Players assume the role of V, a mercenary outlaw in pursuit of a unique implant that holds the key to immortality. The game allows extensive customization of cyberware, skills, and playstyle. Choices made throughout the journey influence both the narrative and the world.\n\nIn 2077, following an economic collapse sometime during the early 21st century, the United States is forced to rely on large corporations to survive. These corporations deal in a wide range of areas, such as weapons, robotics, cybernetics, pharmaceuticals, communications and biotechnology, and many of these companies operate above the law. The world in between is where decadence, sex and pop culture mix with violent crime, extreme poverty and the unattainable promise of the American Dream. You play as V, a mercenary outlaw deeply embedded in the crime-ridden city of Night City, going after a one-of-a-kind implant that is the key to immortality.",

Geralt's new mission comes in dark times as the mysterious and otherworldly army known as the Wild Hunt invades the Northern Kingdoms, leaving only blood soaked earth and fiery ruin in its wake; and it seems the Witcher is the key to stopping their cataclysmic rampage."

Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!\n \n  Features  \n\n    Turn your overgrown field into a lively farm!    \nRaise animals, grow crops, start an orchard, craft useful machines, and more! You'll have plenty of space to create the farm of your dreams. \n \n    8 Player Farming!  \nInvite 1-7 players to join you in the valley online! Players can work together to build a thriving farm, share resources, and improve the local community.  As more hands are better than one, players have the option to scale profit margin on produce sold for a more challenging experience.\n \n    Improve your skills over time.   \nAs you make your way from a struggling greenhorn to a master farmer, you'll level up in 5 different areas: farming, mining, combat, fishing, and foraging. As you progress, you'll learn new cooking and crafting recipes, unlock new areas to explore, and customize your skills by choosing from a variety of professions. \n \n    Become part of the local community.   \nWith over 30 unique characters living in Stardew Valley, you won't have a problem finding new friends! Each person has their own daily schedule, birthday, unique mini-cutscenes, and new things to say throughout the week and year. As you make friends with them, they will open up to you, ask you for help with their personal troubles, or tell you their secrets! Take part in seasonal festivals such as the luau, haunted maze, and feast of the winter star. \n \n    Explore a vast, mysterious cave.   \nAs you travel deeper underground, you'll encounter new and dangerous monsters, powerful weapons, new environments, valuable gemstones, raw materials for crafting and upgrading tools, and mysteries to be uncovered. \n \n    Breathe new life into the valley.  \nSince JojaMart opened, the old way of life in Stardew Valley has changed. Much of the town's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair. Help restore Stardew Valley to it's former glory by repairing the old community center, or take the alternate route and join forces with Joja Corporation.\n \n    Court and marry a partner to share your life on the farm with.   \nThere are 12 available bachelors and bachelorettes to woo, each with unique character progression cutscenes. Once married, your partner will live on the farm with you. Who knows, maybe you'll have kids and start a family?\n \n    Spend a relaxing afternoon at one of the local fishing spots.   \nThe waters are teeming with seasonal varieties of delicious fish. Craft bait, bobbers, and crab pots to help you in your journey toward catching every fish and becoming a local legend! \n \n    Donate artifacts and minerals to the local museum.  \n \n    Cook delicious meals and craft useful items to help you out.   \nWith over 100 cooking and crafting recipes, you'll have a wide variety of items to create.

A hardcore RPG skillset, a vast map, a massively customisable sandbox and a cute tutorial raccoon await the unwary. So how will you die?\n\nThe Knox Event is used to refer to the zombie outbreak that occurs prior to and throughout the game. The event first takes place around Muldraugh and West Point, Kentucky. The incident is considered to have begun on the 4th of July, 1993, American Day of Independence. Just two days later the military evacuated residences from around the affected area and set up blockades in what is now known as the Knox Evacuation. The affected area is given the name: the Exclusion Zone, with the primary camp being south of Louisville.",

        "brief": "Minecraft focuses on allowing the player to explore, interact with, and modify a dynamically generated map made of one-cubic-meter-sized blocks. In addition to blocks, the environment features plants, mobs, and items. Some activities in the game include mining for ore, fighting hostile mobs, and crafting new blocks and tools by gathering various resources found in the game. The game's open-ended model allows players to create structures, creations, and artwork on various multiplayer servers or their single-player maps. Other features include redstone circuits for logic computations and remote actions, minecarts and tracks, and a mysterious underworld called the Nether. A designated but completely optional goal of the game is to travel to a dimension called the End, and defeat the ender dragon.\n\nMinecraft: Java Edition (previously known as Minecraft) is the original version of Minecraft, developed by Mojang Studios for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Notch began development on May 10, 2009, publicly releasing Minecraft on May 17, 2009. The full release of the game was on November 18, 2011, at MINECON 2011.",

Grindelwald ha piani estremi, sul mondo dei maghi e su quello dei non maghi, e si dirige a radunare i suoi seguaci, pescando tra le fila degli scontenti per i metodi repressivi e violenti del Ministero della Magia. Ma in particolare cerca Credence, l'Obscuriale miracolosamente scampato alla morte. Anche Newt Scamander, il timido magizoologo, \u00e8 sulle tracce del ragazzo, per conto di Albus Silente.

Produzent Christof entwarf eine k\u00fcnstliche Welt, genannt Seahaven, in der Truman von \u00fcber 5000 Kameras 24 Stunden am Tag bei fast jeder Kleinigkeit beobachtet wird.

Neo himself has discovered his superpowers including super speed, ability to see the codes of the things inside the matrix and a certain degree of pre-cognition. But a nasty piece of news hits the human resistance: 250,000 machine sentinels are digging to Zion and would reach them in 72 hours. As Zion prepares for the ultimate war, Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are advised by the Oracle to find the Keymaker who would help them reach the Source. Meanwhile Neo\u2019s recurrent dreams depicting Trinity\u2019s death have got him worried and as if it was not enough, Agent Smith has somehow escaped deletion, has become more powerful than before and has fixed Neo as his next target.",

In early 1990, The Wedding Present re-recorded \"Brassneck\" with Steve Albini, which reached #24 in the UK charts.

        "description": "The Downward Spiral is the second studio album by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released on March 8, 1994, by Nothing Records in the United States and Island Records in Europe. It is a concept album detailing the self-destruction of a man from the beginning of his misanthropic \"downward spiral\" to his suicidal breaking point. The album was a commercial success and established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s music scene, with its sound being widely imitated, and the band receiving media attention and multiple honors. \n\nTrent Reznor, the band's sole official member at the time, had moved to 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, the site of the murder of actress Sharon Tate by members of the Manson Family in 1969; it was transformed into a studio for recording the Broken EP (1992) and subsequently The Downward Spiral. The album features elements of industrial rock, techno, metal and ambient soundscapes, in contrast to the band's synth-pop-influenced debut album Pretty Hate Machine (1989). Reznor was strongly influenced by David Bowie's Low and Pink Floyd's The Wall for their themes of introspection and dissociation, and their focus on texture and space. ",

The album features elements of industrial rock, techno, metal and ambient soundscapes, in contrast to the band's synth-pop-influenced debut album Pretty Hate Machine (1989). Reznor was strongly influenced by David Bowie's Low and Pink Floyd's The Wall for their themes of introspection and dissociation, and their focus on texture and space. "

The album was based largely on the band's first commercial demo tape of the same name, completed 11 months prior to the album's release. The tape contained earlier recordings of seven of the ten songs.\n\nWith politically themed, revolutionary lyrical content, the album artwork was notable for its graphic photograph of Vietnamese monk Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c performing self-immolation in June 1963.

        "description": "Place: Seville, Spain, and surrounding hills\nTime: Around 1820\nAct 1\nA square, in Seville. On the right, a door to the tobacco factory. At the back, a bridge. On the left, a guardhouse.\nA group of soldiers relaxes in the square, waiting for the changing of the guard and commenting on the passers-by (\"Sur la place, chacun passe\"). Mica\u00ebla appears, seeking Jos\u00e9. Moral\u00e8s tells her that \"Jos\u00e9 is not yet on duty\" and invites her to wait with them. She declines, saying she will return later. Jos\u00e9 arrives with the new guard, who is greeted and imitated by a crowd of urchins (\"Avec la garde montante\").\nAs the factory bell rings, the cigarette girls emerge and exchange banter with young men in the crowd (\"La cloche a sonn\u00e9\"). Carmen enters and sings her provocative habanera on the untameable nature of love (\"L'amour est un oiseau rebelle\"). The men plead with her to choose a lover, and after some teasing she throws a flower to Don Jos\u00e9, who thus far has been ignoring her but is now annoyed by her insolence.\nAs the women go back to the factory, Mica\u00ebla returns and gives Jos\u00e9 a letter and a kiss from his mother (\"Parle-moi de ma m\u00e8re!\"). He reads that his mother wants him to return home and marry Mica\u00ebla, who retreats in shy embarrassment on learning this. Just as Jos\u00e9 declares that he is ready to heed his mother's wishes, the women stream from the factory in great agitation. Zuniga, the officer of the guard, learns that Carmen has attacked a woman with a knife. When challenged, Carmen answers with mocking defiance (\"Tra la la... Coupe-moi, br\u00fble-moi\"); Zuniga orders Jos\u00e9 to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant. Left alone with Jos\u00e9, Carmen beguiles him with a seguidilla, in which she sings of a night of dancing and passion with her lover\u2014whoever that may be\u2014in Lillas Pastia's tavern. Confused yet mesmerised, Jos\u00e9 agrees to free her hands; as she is led away she pushes her escort to the ground and runs off laughing.

Zu Hilfe!\" segued into trio: \"Stirb, Ungeheuer, durch uns're Macht!\"). He faints, and three ladies, attendants of the Queen of the Night, appear and kill the serpent. They find the unconscious prince extremely attractive, and each of them tries to convince the other two to leave. After arguing, they reluctantly decide to leave together.\nTamino wakes up, and is surprised to find himself still alive. Papageno enters dressed as a bird. He describes his life as a bird-catcher, complaining he has no wife or girlfriend (aria: \"Der Vogelf\u00e4nger bin ich ja\"). Tamino introduces himself to Papageno, thinking Papageno killed the serpent. Papageno happily takes the credit \u2013 claiming he strangled it with his bare hands. The three ladies suddenly reappear and instead of giving Papageno wine, cake and figs, they give him water, a stone and place a padlock over his mouth as a warning not to lie. They give Tamino a portrait of the Queen of the Night's daughter Pamina, with whom Tamino falls instantly in love (aria: \"Dies Bildnis ist bezaubernd sch\u00f6n\" / This image is enchantingly beautiful).\nThe ladies return and tell Tamino that Pamina has been captured by Sarastro, whom they describe as a powerful, evil demon. Tamino vows to rescue Pamina. The Queen of the Night appears and promises Tamino that Pamina will be his if he rescues her from Sarastro (Recitative and aria: \"O zittre nicht, mein lieber Sohn\" / Oh, tremble not, my dear son!). The Queen leaves and the ladies remove the padlock from Papageno's mouth with a warning not to lie any more. They give Tamino a magic flute which has the power to change sorrow into joy. They tell Papageno to go with Tamino, and give him (Papageno) magic bells for protection. The ladies introduce three child-spirits, who will guide Tamino and Papageno to Sarastro's temple. Together Tamino and Papageno set forth (Quintet: \"Hm! Hm! Hm! Hm!\").\nScene 2: A room in Sarastro's palace\nPamina is dragged in by Sarastro's slaves, apparently having tried to escape. Monostatos, a blackamoor and chief of the slaves, orders the slaves to chain her and leave him alone with her. Papageno, sent ahead by Tamino to help find Pamina, enters (Trio: \"Du feines T\u00e4ubchen, nur herein!\"). Monostatos and Papageno are each terrified by the other's strange appearance and both flee. Papageno returns and announces to Pamina that her mother has sent Tamino to save her. Pamina rejoices to hear that Tamino is in love with her. She offers sympathy and hope to Papageno, who longs for a wife. Together they reflect on the joys and sacred duties of marital love (duet: \"Bei M\u00e4nnern welche Liebe f\u00fchlen\").\nFinale. Scene 3: A grove in front of a temple\nThe three child-spirits lead Tamino to Sarastro's temple, promising that if he remains patient, wise and steadfast, he will succeed in rescuing Pamina (Quartet: \"Zum Ziele f\u00fchrt dich diese Bahn\"). Tamino approaches the left-hand entrance and is denied access by voices from within. The same happens when he goes to the entrance on the right. But from the entrance in the middle, an old priest appears and lets Tamino in. (The old priest is referred to as \"The Speaker\" in the libretto, but his role is a singing role.) He tells Tamino that Sarastro is benevolent, not evil, and that he should not trust the Queen of the Night. He promises that Tamino's confusion will be lifted when Tamino approaches the temple in a spirit of friendship. Tamino plays his magic flute. Animals appear and dance, enraptured, to his music. Tamino hears Papageno's pipes sounding offstage, and hurries off to find him (aria: \"Wie stark ist nicht dein Zauberton\").\nPapageno and Pamina enter, searching for Tamino (trio: \"Schnelle F\u00fc\u00dfe, rascher Mut\"). They are recaptured by Monostatos and his slaves. Papageno plays his magic bells, and Monostatos and his slaves begin to dance, and exit the stage, still dancing, mesmerised by the beauty of the music (chorus: \"Das klinget so herrlich\"). Papageno and Pamina hear the sound of Sarastro's retinue approaching. Papageno is frightened and asks Pamina what they should say. She answers that they must tell the truth. Sarastro enters, with a crowd of followers. (chorus: \"Es lebe Sarastro!\")\nPamina falls at Sarastro's feet and confesses that she tried to escape because Monostatos had forced his attentions on her. Sarastro receives her kindly and assures her that he wishes only for her happiness. But he refuses to return her to her mother, whom he describes as a proud, headstrong woman, and a bad influence on those around her. Pamina, he says, must be guided by a man.\nMonostatos brings in Tamino. The two lovers see one another for the first time and embrace, causing indignation among Sarastro's followers. Monostatos tells Sarastro that he caught Papageno and Pamina trying to escape, and demands a reward. Sarastro, however, punishes Monostatos for his lustful behaviour toward Pamina, and sends him away. He announces that Tamino must undergo trials of wisdom in order to become worthy as Pamina's husband. The priests declare that virtue and righteousness will sanctify life and make mortals like gods (\"Wenn Tugend und Gerechtigkeit\").\nAct 2\nScene 1: A grove of palms\nThe council of priests of Isis and Osiris, headed by Sarastro, enters to the sound of a solemn march. Sarastro tells the priests that Tamino is ready to undergo the ordeals that will lead to enlightenment. He invokes the gods Isis and Osiris, asking them to protect Tamino and Pamina (Aria and chorus: \"O Isis und Osiris\").\nScene 2: The courtyard of the Temple of Ordeal\nTamino and Papageno are led in by two priests for the first trial. The two priests advise Tamino and Papageno of the dangers ahead of them, warn them of women's wiles and swear them to silence (Duet: \"Bewahret euch von Weibert\u00fccken\"). The three ladies appear and try to frighten Tamino and Papageno into speaking. (Quintet: \"Wie, wie, wie\") Papageno cannot resist answering the ladies, but Tamino remains aloof, angrily instructing Papageno not to listen to the ladies' threats and to keep quiet. Seeing that Tamino will not speak to them, the ladies withdraw in confusion.\nScene 3: A garden\nPamina is asleep. Monostatos approaches and gazes upon her with rapture. (Aria: \"Alles f\u00fchlt der Liebe Freuden\") He is about to kiss the sleeping Pamina, when the Queen of the Night appears. Monostatos hides. In response to the Queen's questioning, Pamina explains that Tamino is joining Sarastro's brotherhood and she is thinking of accompanying him too. The Queen is not pleased. She explains that her husband was the previous owner of the temple and on his deathbed, gave the ownership to Sarastro instead of her, rendering the Queen powerless (this is in the original libretto, but is usually omitted from modern productions, to shorten the scene with Pamina and her mother). She gives Pamina a dagger, ordering her to kill Sarastro with it and threatening to disown her if she does not. (Aria: \"Der H\u00f6lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen\"). She leaves. Monostatos returns and tries to force Pamina's love by threatening to reveal the Queen's plot, but Sarastro enters and drives him off. Pamina begs Sarastro to forgive her mother and he reassures her that revenge and cruelty have no place in his domain (Aria: \"In diesen heil'gen Hallen\").\nScene 4: A hall in the Temple of Ordeal\nTamino and Papageno are led in by priests, who remind them that they must remain silent. Papageno complains of thirst. An old woman enters and offers Papageno a cup of water. He drinks and teasingly asks whether she has a boyfriend. She replies that she does and that his name is Papageno. She disappears as Papageno asks for her name, and the three child-spirits bring in food, the magic flute, and the bells, sent from Sarastro (Trio: \"Seid uns zum zweiten Mal willkommen\"). Tamino begins to play the flute, which summons Pamina. She tries to speak with him, but Tamino, bound by his vow of silence, cannot answer her, and Pamina begins to believe that he no longer loves her. (Aria: \"Ach, ich f\u00fchl's, es ist verschwunden\") She leaves in despair.\nScene 5: The pyramids\nThe priests celebrate Tamino's successes so far, and pray that he will succeed and become worthy of their order (Chorus: \"O Isis und Osiris\"). Pamina is brought in and Sarastro instructs Pamina and Tamino to bid each other farewell before the greater trials ahead, alarming them by describing it as their \"final farewell\". (Trio: Sarastro, Pamina, Tamino \u2013 \"Soll ich dich, Teurer, nicht mehr sehn?\" Note: In order to preserve the continuity of Pamina's suicidal feelings, this trio is sometimes performed earlier in act 2, preceding or immediately following Sarastro's aria \"O Isis und Osiris\".[f][30]) They exit and Papageno enters. The priests grant his request for a glass of wine and he expresses his desire for a wife. (Aria: \"Ein M\u00e4dchen oder Weibchen\"). The elderly woman reappears and warns him that unless he immediately promises to marry her, he will be imprisoned forever. When Papageno promises to love her faithfully (muttering that he will only do this until something better comes along), she is transformed into the young and pretty Papagena. Papageno rushes to embrace her, but the priests drive him back, telling him that he is not yet worthy of her.\nFinale. Scene 6: A garden\nThe three child-spirits hail the dawn. They observe Pamina, who is contemplating suicide because she believes Tamino has abandoned her. The child-spirits restrain her and reassure her of Tamino's love. (Quartet: \"Bald prangt, den Morgen zu verk\u00fcnden\").\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 7: Outside the Temple of Ordeal\nTwo men in armor lead in Tamino. They recite one of the formal creeds of Isis and Osiris, promising enlightenment to those who successfully overcome the fear of death (\"Der, welcher wandert diese Strasse voll Beschwerden\"). This recitation takes the musical form of a Baroque chorale prelude, to a tune inspired by Martin Luther's hymn \"Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein\" (Oh God, look down from heaven).[g][32] Tamino declares that he is ready to be tested. Pamina calls to him from offstage. The men in armour assure him that the trial by silence is over and he is free to speak with her. Pamina enters and declares her intention to undergo the remaining trials with him. She hands him the magic flute to help them through the trials (\"Tamino mein, o welch ein Gl\u00fcck!\"). Protected by the music of the magic flute, they pass unscathed through chambers of fire and water. Offstage, the priests hail their triumph and invite the couple to enter the temple.\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 8: A garden with a tree\nPapageno despairs at having lost Papagena and decides to hang himself (Aria/Quartet: \"Papagena! Papagena! Papagena! Weibchen, T\u00e4ubchen, meine Sch\u00f6ne\") The three child-spirits appear and stop him. They advise him to play his magic bells to summon Papagena. She appears and, united, the happy couple stutter in astonishment and make bird-like courting sounds at each other. They plan their future and dream of the many children they will have together (Duet: \"Pa... pa... pa...\").\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 9: A rocky landscape outside the temple; night\nThe traitorous Monostatos appears with the Queen of the Night and her three ladies. They plot to destroy the temple (\"Nur stille, stille\") and the Queen confirms that she has promised her daughter Pamina to Monostatos. But before the conspirators can enter the temple, they are magically cast out into eternal night.\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 10: The Temple of the Sun\nSarastro announces the sun's triumph over the night, and hails the dawn of a new era of wisdom and brotherhood. Animals appear again and dance in the sun.",

Zu Hilfe!\" segued into trio: \"Stirb, Ungeheuer, durch uns're Macht!\"). He faints, and three ladies, attendants of the Queen of the Night, appear and kill the serpent. They find the unconscious prince extremely attractive, and each of them tries to convince the other two to leave.

(Quintet: \"Wie, wie, wie\") Papageno cannot resist answering the ladies, but Tamino remains aloof, angrily instructing Papageno not to listen to the ladies' threats and to keep quiet. Seeing that Tamino will not speak to them, the ladies withdraw in confusion.\nScene 3: A garden\nPamina is asleep. Monostatos approaches and gazes upon her with rapture. (Aria: \"Alles f\u00fchlt der Liebe Freuden\") He is about to kiss the sleeping Pamina, when the Queen of the Night appears. Monostatos hides. In response to the Queen's questioning, Pamina explains that Tamino is joining Sarastro's brotherhood and she is thinking of accompanying him too. The Queen is not pleased. She explains that her husband was the previous owner of the temple and on his deathbed, gave the ownership to Sarastro instead of her, rendering the Queen powerless (this is in the original libretto, but is usually omitted from modern productions, to shorten the scene with Pamina and her mother). She gives Pamina a dagger, ordering her to kill Sarastro with it and threatening to disown her if she does not. (Aria: \"Der H\u00f6lle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen\"). She leaves. Monostatos returns and tries to force Pamina's love by threatening to reveal the Queen's plot, but Sarastro enters and drives him off. Pamina begs Sarastro to forgive her mother and he reassures her that revenge and cruelty have no place in his domain (Aria: \"In diesen heil'gen Hallen\").\nScene 4: A hall in the Temple of Ordeal\nTamino and Papageno are led in by priests, who remind them that they must remain silent. Papageno complains of thirst. An old woman enters and offers Papageno a cup of water. He drinks and teasingly asks whether she has a boyfriend. She replies that she does and that his name is Papageno. She disappears as Papageno asks for her name, and the three child-spirits bring in food, the magic flute, and the bells, sent from Sarastro (Trio: \"Seid uns zum zweiten Mal willkommen\"). Tamino begins to play the flute, which summons Pamina. She tries to speak with him, but Tamino, bound by his vow of silence, cannot answer her, and Pamina begins to believe that he no longer loves her. (Aria: \"Ach, ich f\u00fchl's, es ist verschwunden\") She leaves in despair.\nScene 5: The pyramids\nThe priests celebrate Tamino's successes so far, and pray that he will succeed and become worthy of their order (Chorus: \"O Isis und Osiris\"). Pamina is brought in and Sarastro instructs Pamina and Tamino to bid each other farewell before the greater trials ahead, alarming them by describing it as their \"final farewell\". (Trio: Sarastro, Pamina, Tamino \u2013 \"Soll ich dich, Teurer, nicht mehr sehn?\" Note: In order to preserve the continuity of Pamina's suicidal feelings, this trio is sometimes performed earlier in act 2, preceding or immediately following Sarastro's aria \"O Isis und Osiris\".[f][30]) They exit and Papageno enters. The priests grant his request for a glass of wine and he expresses his desire for a wife. (Aria: \"Ein M\u00e4dchen oder Weibchen\"). The elderly woman reappears and warns him that unless he immediately promises to marry her, he will be imprisoned forever. When Papageno promises to love her faithfully (muttering that he will only do this until something better comes along), she is transformed into the young and pretty Papagena. Papageno rushes to embrace her, but the priests drive him back, telling him that he is not yet worthy of her.\nFinale. Scene 6: A garden\nThe three child-spirits hail the dawn. They observe Pamina, who is contemplating suicide because she believes Tamino has abandoned her. The child-spirits restrain her and reassure her of Tamino's love. (Quartet: \"Bald prangt, den Morgen zu verk\u00fcnden\").\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 7: Outside the Temple of Ordeal\nTwo men in armor lead in Tamino. They recite one of the formal creeds of Isis and Osiris, promising enlightenment to those who successfully overcome the fear of death (\"Der, welcher wandert diese Strasse voll Beschwerden\"). This recitation takes the musical form of a Baroque chorale prelude, to a tune inspired by Martin Luther's hymn \"Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein\" (Oh God, look down from heaven).[g][32] Tamino declares that he is ready to be tested. Pamina calls to him from offstage. The men in armour assure him that the trial by silence is over and he is free to speak with her. Pamina enters and declares her intention to undergo the remaining trials with him. She hands him the magic flute to help them through the trials (\"Tamino mein, o welch ein Gl\u00fcck!\"). Protected by the music of the magic flute, they pass unscathed through chambers of fire and water. Offstage, the priests hail their triumph and invite the couple to enter the temple.\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 8: A garden with a tree\nPapageno despairs at having lost Papagena and decides to hang himself (Aria/Quartet: \"Papagena! Papagena! Papagena! Weibchen, T\u00e4ubchen, meine Sch\u00f6ne\") The three child-spirits appear and stop him. They advise him to play his magic bells to summon Papagena. She appears and, united, the happy couple stutter in astonishment and make bird-like courting sounds at each other. They plan their future and dream of the many children they will have together (Duet: \"Pa... pa... pa...\").\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 9: A rocky landscape outside the temple; night\nThe traitorous Monostatos appears with the Queen of the Night and her three ladies. They plot to destroy the temple (\"Nur stille, stille\") and the Queen confirms that she has promised her daughter Pamina to Monostatos. But before the conspirators can enter the temple, they are magically cast out into eternal night.\nScene change without interrupting the music, to Scene 10: The Temple of the Sun\nSarastro announces the sun's triumph over the night, and hails the dawn of a new era of wisdom and brotherhood. Animals appear again and dance in the sun.",

I Rossinis opera har den fiffige Figaro endnu ikke m\u00f8dt sin udk\u00e5rne Susanna - han hj\u00e6lper derimod sin elskovssyge ven Grev Almaviva med at vriste den eftertragtede Rosina ud af hendes griske v\u00e6rge Don Bartolos klamme h\u00e6nder.\n\nMartin Lyngbos tempofyldte slapstick-iscenes\u00e6ttelse fremh\u00e6ver den lette og lystige historie med Rossinis i\u00f8refaldende musik. Barberen i Sevilla h\u00f8stede fremragende anmeldelser ved premieren i 2018. Pressen skrev blandt andet, at \u201cid\u00e9en om at overs\u00e6tte Rossinis komiske opera Barberen i Sevilla til stumfilm er t\u00e6t p\u00e5 genial.\u201d\n\nTheodore Platt fra Den Kongelige Operas solistensemble og Dean Murphy kan opleves i titelrollen, og grev Almaviva synges alternerende af den store Rossinisanger Sunnyboy Dladla og anmelderroste Liam Bonthrone.\n\nDenne forrygende og h\u00e6sbl\u00e6sende udgave af Barberen i Sevilla er musikalsk og visuelt underholdende for b\u00e5de nye operag\u00e6ster og garvede operafans, der s\u00e6tter pris p\u00e5 klassikerne i nye kl\u00e6der."

The work dates from 1735 except for the last entr\u00e9e, which was added the following year. In 1761, however, Rameau dropped the relatively short and mildly contrasted third entr\u00e9e so as to leave what is now considered the work's definitive form: Prologue; Le turc g\u00e9n\u00e9reux (The Generous Turk); Les incas du P\u00e9rou (The Incas of Peru); and Les sauvages (The Savages of North America).

        "brief": " Solarpunk Presents is a podcast that explores the people and projects working on bringing us a better world today.\n \n  Solarpunk is more than just an idea, more than just an aesthetic. Those inspire us, but where do we go from there? How do we put the values and visions described in solarpunk fiction and art into action in the here and now? What does that look like, translated into the reality of our present moment, into the places and spaces where we\u2019re at? Hosts Ariel Kroon and Christina De La Rocha are producing podcast episodes featuring interviews with people working to make the world a better place right now, as well as discussions of solarpunk, DIY, aesthetic, housing, and more.

Join a typical grammarian and classicist as I expand your vocabulary, understanding of grammar, Etymology, terminology (i.e. legal, medical, botanical, etc.), and so much more. I also utilize this platform to expand on greater thoughts of mine, as well as discussing the importance of language and the promotion of \"The Language Revival\" (as I like to call it...) Thank you for your interested in knowledge, language acquisition, the command of one's own language, and the understanding of the world.",

Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a Titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a Colossal Titan that appears out of thin air.
