The first press contains a Gundam 00 sticker, which differs between limited edition and regular edition, along with Allelujah Haptism's character ID card. The song's music video also made several references to Gundam 00 such as the appearance of Lockon's Haro and Tomoko dressed as Wang Liu Mei. The song was released coincidentally with the band's singer's birthday.

It was released on June 26, 2001, by J Records. A classically trained pianist, Keys wrote, arranged and produced the majority of the album herself, though she frequently worked with her then-partner Kerry \"Krucial\" Brothers. The efforts resulted in a neo soul record fusing contemporary classical music with R&B, soul, and jazz, alongside influences of hip-hop, blues, and gospel. Its lyrics focus on themes of love, perseverance, self-worth, survival, and introspection. Despite the album's title, only two of its tracks are composed in the key of A minor.
