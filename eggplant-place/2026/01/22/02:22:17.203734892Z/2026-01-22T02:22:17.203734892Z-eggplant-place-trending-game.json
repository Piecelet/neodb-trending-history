The game was ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards.\n\nTomoya Okazaki is a third year high school student at Hikarizaka Private High School, leading a life full of resentment. His mother passed away in a car accident when he was young, leading his father, Naoyuki, to resort to alcohol and gambling to cope. This resulted in constant fights between the two until Naoyuki dislocated Tomoya\u2019s shoulder. Unable to play on his basketball team, Tomoya began to distance himself from other people. Ever since he has had a distant relationship with his father, naturally becoming a delinquent over time.\n\nWhile on a walk to school, Tomoya meets a strange girl named Nagisa Furukawa, questioning if she likes the school at all.

The two track a cell to Cozumel in Mexico that is led by Pedro Dominguez, the head of Trinity's High Council. Slipping inside nearby tombs being excavated by Trinity, Lara discovers a temple containing the Dagger of Chak Chel and references to a hidden city. Murals adorning the walls allude to the Silver Box of Ix Chel and warn of \"the Cleansing\", a Mayan apocalypse culminating in a permanent solar eclipse. Lara ignores the warnings and takes the Dagger to prevent Trinity from acquiring it. Dominguez catches her and reveals that by taking the Dagger, Lara has triggered the Cleansing. He takes the Dagger, intending to unite it with the Box to stop the Cleansing and use the power it grants him to remake the world in his image. Lara and Jonah escape a tsunami that destroys Cozumel and foreshadows the coming apocalypse.\nDespite growing tensions between them over her actions, Lara and Jonah pursue Dominguez into the Amazon. Their plane crashes in the Peruvian jungle during the second cataclysm\u2014a massive storm\u2014and the two find their way to Paititi, the hidden city shown in the murals. Exploring local tombs reveals that piercing the Box with the Dagger will grant the user the power of the god Kukulkan, which must be used to halt the Cleansing. Lara witnesses Trinity soldiers being slaughtered by strange humanoid monsters later identified as the Yaaxil, guardians of the Box. When Lara saves a boy named Etzli, she and Jonah are brought into Paititi by his mother Unuratu, queen of the city. Lara sees Dominguez is the leader of a cult dedicated to Kukulkan and Unuratu reveals he is her brother-in-law Amaru, who was taken by Trinity as a child and raised to complete the ritual and reshape the world in their image. Unuratu directs Lara to the Box, but Lara finds it is missing. Believing the cult already has the Box, Lara, and Unuratu attempt to steal it, but Unuratu is captured. Lara also encounters the Yaaxil and their leader Crimson Fire.\nLara infiltrates the cult's temple and overhears Amaru telling Unuratu that the Box was hidden by Andres Lopez, a missionary sent to Paititi by Trinity during the Spanish conquest of South America. Lara rescues Unuratu and realizes that Amaru does not fully understand the ritual; rather than merely imbuing Kukulkan's power, the ritual sacrifices it to stop the Cleansing. Unuratu is shot by Commander Rourke, Amaru's second in command. Before she dies, Unuratu implores Lara to complete the ritual but warns her not to let the Box influence her. Rourke attacks Lara and Jonah, who are separated as they leave Paititi to decipher the next clue. Thinking Jonah dead, Lara goes on a rampage that destroys an oil refinery and slaughters everyone there except Rourke, who escapes. She momentarily breaks down when she finds Jonah alive, but he manages to calm her, and they decipher the Box's location. Driven mad by the Box, Lopez established a mission near Paititi where he trained acolytes to complete the ritual. Lara and Jonah find a secret catacomb beneath the missiong leading to Lopez's tomb and the Box. Amaru finds them and forces Lara to surrender the Box. He admits that he ordered her father's death to prevent him from finding Paititi and revealing it to the world. Lara tries to persuade Amaru to use the ritual to benefit the world. He refuses, as the Cleansing will only affect Paititi. Amaru has used his position in Trinity to manipulate them into preventing it. He leaves Lara and Jonah to escape the third cataclysm, a massive earthquake that causes a landslide and destroys the mission.\nBack in Paititi, Lara and Jonah help the newly-crowned Etzli lead an assault on an underground temple complex at Paititi's center. They plan to disrupt Amaru's ceremony while avoiding the fourth cataclysm, a volcanic eruption threatening Paititi. Lara is forced to go on alone when Trinity cuts off Etzli's forces. She encounters the Yaaxil and Crimson Fire, convincing them to help her stop Amaru. Lara takes on the symbolic role of Ix Chel while Crimson Fire becomes Chak Chel. While the Yaaxil kill Rourke and the Trinity High Council, Lara makes it to the temple summit. She fails to stop Amaru from piercing the Box and absorbing Kukulkan's power as an eclipse blocks the sun. Lara overpowers Amaru after a lengthy battle; accepting defeat, he transfers Kukulkan's power to Lara as he dies. True to Unuratu's warning, she is tempted to use the Box to revive her parents, but instead lets Crimson Fire symbolically stab her, sacrificing Kukulkan's spirit and stopping the Cleansing. In the aftermath, Unuratu is laid to rest, and Jonah decides to take a vacation. Lara stays in Paititi to help Etzli restore the city to its former glory.

The two track a cell to Cozumel in Mexico that is led by Pedro Dominguez, the head of Trinity's High Council. Slipping inside nearby tombs being excavated by Trinity, Lara discovers a temple containing the Dagger of Chak Chel and references to a hidden city. Murals adorning the walls allude to the Silver Box of Ix Chel and warn of \"the Cleansing\", a Mayan apocalypse culminating in a permanent solar eclipse. Lara ignores the warnings and takes the Dagger to prevent Trinity from acquiring it. Dominguez catches her and reveals that by taking the Dagger, Lara has triggered the Cleansing. He takes the Dagger, intending to unite it with the Box to stop the Cleansing and use the power it grants him to remake the world in his image. Lara and Jonah escape a tsunami that destroys Cozumel and foreshadows the coming apocalypse.\nDespite growing tensions between them over her actions, Lara and Jonah pursue Dominguez into the Amazon. Their plane crashes in the Peruvian jungle during the second cataclysm\u2014a massive storm\u2014and the two find their way to Paititi, the hidden city shown in the murals. Exploring local tombs reveals that piercing the Box with the Dagger will grant the user the power of the god Kukulkan, which must be used to halt the Cleansing. Lara witnesses Trinity soldiers being slaughtered by strange humanoid monsters later identified as the Yaaxil, guardians of the Box. When Lara saves a boy named Etzli, she and Jonah are brought into Paititi by his mother Unuratu, queen of the city. Lara sees Dominguez is the leader of a cult dedicated to Kukulkan and Unuratu reveals he is her brother-in-law Amaru, who was taken by Trinity as a child and raised to complete the ritual and reshape the world in their image. Unuratu directs Lara to the Box, but Lara finds it is missing. Believing the cult already has the Box, Lara, and Unuratu attempt to steal it, but Unuratu is captured. Lara also encounters the Yaaxil and their leader Crimson Fire.\nLara infiltrates the cult's temple and overhears Amaru telling Unuratu that the Box was hidden by Andres Lopez, a missionary sent to Paititi by Trinity during the Spanish conquest of South America. Lara rescues Unuratu and realizes that Amaru does not fully understand the ritual; rather than merely imbuing Kukulkan's power, the ritual sacrifices it to stop the Cleansing. Unuratu is shot by Commander Rourke, Amaru's second in command. Before she dies, Unuratu implores Lara to complete the ritual but warns her not to let the Box influence her. Rourke attacks Lara and Jonah, who are separated as they leave Paititi to decipher the next clue. Thinking Jonah dead, Lara goes on a rampage that destroys an oil refinery and slaughters everyone there except Rourke, who escapes. She momentarily breaks down when she finds Jonah alive, but he manages to calm her, and they decipher the Box's location. Driven mad by the Box, Lopez established a mission near Paititi where he trained acolytes to complete the ritual. Lara and Jonah find a secret catacomb beneath the missiong leading to Lopez's tomb and the Box. Amaru finds them and forces Lara to surrender the Box. He admits that he ordered her father's death to prevent him from finding Paititi and revealing it to the world. Lara tries to persuade Amaru to use the ritual to benefit the world. He refuses, as the Cleansing will only affect Paititi. Amaru has used his position in Trinity to manipulate them into preventing it. He leaves Lara and Jonah to escape the third cataclysm, a massive earthquake that causes a landslide and destroys the mission.\nBack in Paititi, Lara and Jonah help the newly-crowned Etzli lead an assault on an underground temple complex at Paititi's center. They plan to disrupt Amaru's ceremony while avoiding the fourth cataclysm, a volcanic eruption threatening Paititi. Lara is forced to go on alone when Trinity cuts off Etzli's forces. She encounters the Yaaxil and Crimson Fire, convincing them to help her stop Amaru. Lara takes on the symbolic role of Ix Chel while Crimson Fire becomes Chak Chel. While the Yaaxil kill Rourke and the Trinity High Council, Lara makes it to the temple summit. She fails to stop Amaru from piercing the Box and absorbing Kukulkan's power as an eclipse blocks the sun. Lara overpowers Amaru after a lengthy battle; accepting defeat, he transfers Kukulkan's power to Lara as he dies. True to Unuratu's warning, she is tempted to use the Box to revive her parents, but instead lets Crimson Fire symbolically stab her, sacrificing Kukulkan's spirit and stopping the Cleansing. In the aftermath, Unuratu is laid to rest, and Jonah decides to take a vacation. Lara stays in Paititi to help Etzli restore the city to its former glory. A post-credits scene shows Lara planning her next adventure at Croft Manor, acknowledging that her role is not to solve the world's mysteries, but to protect them.", "id": "https://eggplant.place/game/18XC4B0664fQ8WDCJzMT7k", "uuid": "18XC4B0664fQ8WDCJzMT7k", "url": "/game/18XC4B0664fQ8WDCJzMT7k", "api_url": "/api/game/18XC4B0664fQ8WDCJzMT7k", "category": "game", "parent_uuid": null, "display_title": "Shadow of the Tomb Raider", "external_resources": [{"url": "https://store.steampowered.com/app/750920"}, {"url": "https://www.igdb.com/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider"}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/game/27066097/"}, {"url": "https://neodb.social/game/3pAb6rZhUQXY0DXtHL6gxs"}, {"url": "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q50562677"}]}, {"type": "Game", "title": "Detroit: Become Human", "description": "Featuring world-renowned actors including Jesse Williams (Grey\u2019s Anatomy), Clancy Brown (Carnivale), Lance Henriksen  (Aliens), Bryan Dechart (True Blood) and Valorie Curry (Twilight). \n\nWHAT MAKES US HUMAN?    \n \nDetroit 2038.

As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister; although she is designed to appear encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, tests including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the test. However, GLaDOS declares it must be euthanized in an \"emergency intelligence incinerator\" before Chell can continue.[17] Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled.[20][21]\n\nAfter Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her. Chell escapes with the portal gun and makes her way through the maintenance areas within the Enrichment Center.[22] GLaDOS panics and insists that she was pretending to kill Chell as part of testing. GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the \"party escort submission position\", lying face-first on the ground, so that a \"party associate\" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues her escape. In this section, GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center.[11][12] Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and pastiches of Emily Dickinson's poem \"The Chariot\", Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and Emily Bront\u00eb's \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.[4]\n\nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas. With it removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally, with taunts and juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. Following the announcement of Portal 2, the ending was expanded in a later update. In this retroactive continuity, Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the \"party escort submission position\".[15][23]\n\nThe final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a Black Forest cake,[24] and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores. The cores begin to light up, before a robotic arm descends and extinguishes the candle on the cake, causing the room to blackout.[25] As the credits roll, GLaDOS delivers a concluding report: the song \"Still Alive\", which declares the experiment to be a huge success, as well as serving to indicate to the player that GLaDOS is still alive,[26] that her \"happy\" core was not disabled."}, {"lang": "en", "text": "Portal\u2122 is a new single player game from Valve.

Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won't be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!\n \n  Features  \n\n    Turn your overgrown field into a lively farm!    \nRaise animals, grow crops, start an orchard, craft useful machines, and more! You'll have plenty of space to create the farm of your dreams. \n \n    8 Player Farming!  \nInvite 1-7 players to join you in the valley online! Players can work together to build a thriving farm, share resources, and improve the local community.  As more hands are better than one, players have the option to scale profit margin on produce sold for a more challenging experience.\n \n    Improve your skills over time.   \nAs you make your way from a struggling greenhorn to a master farmer, you'll level up in 5 different areas: farming, mining, combat, fishing, and foraging.

The adventure that ensues soon unveils an evil force set to destroy the world, triggering Crono's race against time to change the course of history and bring about a brighter future.\n\nCrono Meets Marle\n\nIn 1000 A.D., a teenager named Crono from Truce attends a fair made to celebrate 1000 years since the Kingdom of Guardia's founding. While at the fair, he meets Princess Nadia, or Marle, who is the immediate heir to Guardia. Crono and Marle participate in a demonstration of Crono's friend Lucca's teleportation device; a reaction between it and Marle's pendant, handed down for generations, causes a time Gate to open and transport Marle to 600 A.D., the middle ages. Crono immediately follows using the pendant, and discovers that Marle has been mistaken for the Queen of Guardia of that era (Queen Leene had been missing prior to Marle's entrance, and the search party mistook Marle for her). While visiting Marle, Crono watches her vanish; Lucca, after entering the area via a Gate Key (device that can open Gates), explains that Marle's ancestors never being found causes this (On a side note, Lucca is almost surely wrong here, as her explanation contradicts all other instances of temporal transforms in the Chrono series. Marle's detainment was most likely an action done by the Entity to start Crono on his quest). Crono, Lucca, and a knight who is in the form of a frog together rescue Queen Leene; subsequently, Marle reappears in Guardia castle. Crono, Marle, and Lucca depart for 1000 A.D.\n\nLavos is Discovered\n\nLucca immediately heads home, while Crono is instructed to take Marle home to Guardia Castle. Once arrived, Crono is charged with kidnapping the princess and placed on trial. He is found either guilty or not guilty, and sentenced to three days solitary confinement with possibility of execution. With the aid of Lucca, Crono breaks out of jail and battles the Chancellor of Guardia; after winning the fight, Marle joins the party and the trio escape into Guardia Forest. Cornered, they duck into a Gate in a meadow nearby. It speedily warps them to 2300 A.D., in which a battered, ruined world exists. Curious of that era, the trio trek to various futuristic domes and flattened cities (called Labs) and eventually ascertain from a video recording that a giant being, called Lavos, that hibernates beneath the planet (more on this in the forthcoming Lavos article) surfaced in 1999 A.D. and destroyed the entire world. Unwilling to let this pass, Crono's party swear to battle Lavos. While journeying in 2300 A.D., they meet a damaged humanoid robot. Lucca repairs the mechanical man, named Robo, and attempts to return home through a Gate in the Proto Dome, in which Robo was located. A door blocks the way, causing Crono, Robo, and either Lucca or Marle to venture to a nearby factory to restore power to the deactivated doorway. The party then goes through the Gate.\n\nThe End of Time\n\nDue to the Conservation of Time Theorem (see the article Principles of Time and Dimensional Travel), Crono, Marle, Lucca and Robo end up at the End of Time, which is presided over by an old man. The man gives a bit of hope to the party, who are eager to defeat Lavos; before leaving, Crono and friends visit Spekkio, the so-called 'God of War' who also lives with the old man at the end of time. Spekkio imbues each member with magic ability, and afterward provides magic to new members (for the tech of this process, see the forthcoming article on Magic). All Gates connect to the End of Time, the old man states. The party then leaves through a Gate that takes them to 1000 A.D., but to a continent other than the one in which the Kingdom of Guardia is located. The party enters Medina, the town of the Mystics, a race of warlocks and monsters that warred with the humans in 600 A.D. under the leadership of the mage known as Magus. The party must battle a Heckran monster to return to Guardia, and during his final speech the party learns that Magus supposedly created Lavos in 600 A.D. Crono's party then travels to 600 A.D., and finds the Kingdom of Guardia under serious attack. After warding off the Mystics on Zenan Bridge, they learn that a special sword, the Masamune, is capable of defeating Magus. They ascend the Denadoro Mountains to retrieve the swords, and do battle with spirits residual in the blade. After winning, Crono receives a broken piece.\n\nReconstructing the Masamune\n\nThe party then visits the abode of Frog, the knight who helped them save Queen Leene. They receive from him the other piece of the Masamune. In order to repair the blade, the party seeks Melchior, a smith that lives in 1000 A.D. He instructs the party to find Dreamstone, the material used to forge the sword. The party travels to 65,000,000 B.C. and learns that the chief of a village of humans (Ioka Village) engaged in war with a race of sentient beings half-dinosaur, half-human has the mineral in question. Ayla meets the party instantly by fending off Reptites, and invites Crono to a party. By successfully drinking more soup than Ayla, Crono receives the Dreamstone. However, the Reptites undertake a midnight raid on the villagers, stealing the Gate Key. Kino, Ayla's mate, stole the Gate Key out of jealousy for Crono's party, but later surrendered it to the Reptite raiders. Crono's party seeks out the item in question by infiltrating a Reptite hideout within a forest; on this journey, they encounter the Reptite leader, Azala, and coax her forcefully into giving up the Gate Key. Afterwards, the party returns to 1000 A.D. and has Melchior repair the sword. After having it taken to him in 600 A.D., Frog joins the party to avenge the death of his best friend, Cyrus, who fell to Magus in 590 A.D. (It is revealed in a flashback that the squire Glenn was turned into Frog in that event as well). Together, they sojourn to Magus' Lair, and defeat his top knights -- Ozzie, Slash, and Flea. After battling with Magus himself, the party and Magus are devoured by an unfathomably huge time warp caused by the summoning of Lavos he had begun prior to fighting the party. Also, it is here revealed that Magus merely summoned Lavos, and that the notion that he created the beast is false.\n\nThe Magical Kingdom\n\nThe party is thrown to 65,000,000 B.C., while Magus is catapulted to 12,000 B.C., the dark ages. After a Reptite attack demolishes the village of Laruba and concludes with the capture of Kino and other villagers, Ayla and Crono's party opt for a direct assault on the stronghold of the Reptites. After a lengthy battle to Azala's quarters, a fight ensues in which Azala is defeated and his Tyrano defender squelched. Lavos descends at this point (note: Azala did not summon him), pushing Azala's fortress far underground. Crono's party decides to fight Lavos immediately, as he would be weak, having just landed. The party finds a Gate at the impact point, and enters it to reach 12,000 B.C., a time beleaguered by an ice age brought about by Lavos' impact upon the planet. While there, the party finds a teleporation center that leads them to the ancient kingdom of Zeal, composed of several islands floating in the sky, and housing tomes on magic and various elemental sources of power. The party travels through Enhasa, city of sleep (in which a child-prince informs the party that one among them will soon perish), Kajar, city of magic, and lastly reaches Zeal Palace. Here they observe the Mammon Machine, which is used to extract energy from Lavos. Plans for the moving of the machine to a palace under the ocean surface are announced, and the party later battles the evil queen of Zeal, who is aided by a prophet. Schala, sister of the child-prince Janus mentioned above, pleads with the prophet and successfully brings about the sparing of the party. Crono and team are banished from the era, and the Gate by which they came is sealed.\n\nThe Ocean Palace\n\nAt the End of Time, the old man informs the party that a sage in 2300 A.D. was working on a machine that could travel through time. Crono forthwith enters that era, and receives the Epoch from the sage -- albeit his passing away and memories containment in a being known as the Nu. The party returns to 12,000 B.C. via this machine, and explores a cave that houses members of the human race that cannot use magic (called Earthbound) -- as opposed to the magic-users of Zeal. They notify the party of a guru of Zeal's banishment to a floating mountain nearby, and the group departs to this landform to rescue the man. After defeating a guardian, they find the man Melchior (which later elaborates on a peculiarity of the game -- this will be explained at the North Cape). Melchior recognizes that the moving of the Mammon Machine to the undersea palace will result in ruin, and gives the party a Ruby Knife (later becoming the Masamune in the grand scheme of time) to destroy the Mammon Machine with. Schala enters briefly, but is abducted by the Queen's aide, Dalton. Crono and his team use a Skygate at Zeal Palace to infiltrate the Ocean Palace, and battle their way to the grand hall in which the machine is interred. Crono thrusts the knife into the Mammon Machine, but Schala reveals that this shall have no effect. Lavos, awoken by the machines draining effects, appears (this and other phenomena are explained in the forthcoming Lavos article).\n\nThe New World\n\nThe prophet immediately reveals himself to be Magus, and tries to defeat Lavos. He cannot; Queen Zeal stands atop Lavos and the creature begins sucking Magus and Schala towards his maw. Crono bravely sacrifices himself; before the Ocean Palace collapses, Schala transports the remaining party members and Magus out to the main continent (note that what transpires in the Palace after this moment is directly responsible for the whole of Chrono Cross's plot). Lavos annihilates Zeal afterward, causing a tidal wave to engulf most of the land. Magus and Crono's party awaken to find that the Earthbound (those who cannot use magic) have left their cave and are mingling with survivors from Zeal in a place called Last Village. While conversing with the Elder, the party suffers an attack from Dalton, Queen Zeal's former aide. The party is detained upon a flying ship known as the Blackbird, built by the guru Belthasar. Dalton has stolen the Epoch as well, and orders the construction of wings and a flying system complete with weapons. The party manages to escape from prison and battle Dalton; they regain control of the Epoch afterward, and accidentally shoot down the Blackbird. After returning to the ground, the party finds Magus gazing across the sea from the North Cape of the remaining land. Magus reveals that he was Janus, and that he lived only to seek revenge on Lavos. Also revealed is that Melchior, Gaspar (the old man at the End of Time), and Belthasar (builder of the Epoch), the three gurus of Zeal, were originally scattered across time by the Ocean Palace incident that occurred before Crono intervened in time (a villager later remarks that this timelines Melchior and Janus disappeared involuntarily, confirming that they are preserved in history). Magus joins the party, and offers hope for reviving Crono. While leaving the era, they witness the rise of the Ocean Palace into the air, which is now called the Black Omen and is ruled by Queen Zeal.\n\nThe Salvation of Crono\n\nThe party return to the End of Time, where the old man (Gaspar) declares that Crono can be revived by the use of a device called the Chrono Trigger, or Time Egg. In order to do this, however, the party must have a clone of Crono to replace him with. The party travel to 1000 A.D., and at the Millennial Fair, acquire a clone of Crono. They then sojourn to 2300 A.D. as instructed by Gaspar, consulting the memory of Belthasar for instructions on reviving Crono. The party is told to climb Death Peak, a geological formation caused by the eruption of Lavos in 1999 A.D. and the breeding ground of Lavos. At the peak of the mountain, the Chrono Trigger shatters and transports the party to the instant before Crono's death in the Ocean Palace. His body is swapped with the clone, and Crono is extracted to Death Peak. Upon returning to the End of Time, the party are given knowledge by Gaspar of several sidequests that will empower it against Lavos. Firstly, the party ventures to 600 A.D. to restore a forest ruined by one of Magus' creations or associated Mystic monsters known as Retinite. The party enter the desert that is encroaching upon Fiona's Forest, and defeat the beast. Robo decides to stay and till the land for 400 years. After picking him up in 1000 A.D., the party camp in the forest, and have a discussion involving the quest. It is here that Robo proposes the existence of an Entity that shaped the quest of Chrono Trigger in order to destroy Lavos (said Entity is most likely the planet; see the forthcoming Entity article). After the discussion, Lucca finds a special Gate that allows her one chance to save her mother from losing her legs in 990 A.D.\n\nSeveral Sidequests\n\nFollowing this quest, the party and Magus decimate Ozzie, Slash, and Flea's hideout in 600 A.D., eradicating hatred towards humans by the Mystics in 1000 A.D. Next, the party discovers that a crazed AI is exterminating humans on an island in 2300 A.D. Robo is revealed to have originated in the islands facility, and told his purpose was to watch humans. A female robot called Atropos attempts to destroy him due to her brainwashing by the crazed AI (known as Mother Brain). Robo succeeds in fending her off, and eventually defeats Mother Brain -- receiving his greatest weapons in the process. Following this event, the party search for the Sun Stone, a stone charged with solar energy that once powered Zeal. They defeat a monster called the Son of Sun in the Sun Temple of Zeal in 2300 A.D. (it rose off the ocean floor apparently) and locate the Sun Stone. Recognizing that its power has left it, the party deposits it in 65,000,000 B.C. to charge. Finding it stolen by the Porre mayor in 1000 A.D., they instill kindness in the Porre leaderships family by giving free jerky to the Elder's wife in 600 A.D. After the Sun Stone is returned to them by a benevolent mayor in 1000 A.D., it is fully charged by 2300 A.D. and used to make useful items by Lucca.\n\nThe Royal Family\n\nOnce this quest is complete, the party, with Frog, venture to 1000 A.D. to find that Cyrus, the fallen knight and friend of Frog, is restless and haunting his gravesite. Through hiring carpenters, the party repairs the gravesite, locate powerful weapons and armor, and make peace with Cyrus -- resulting in a boost in the power of the Masamune. Following this, the party decide to look for the Rainbow Shell, a priceless mineral formation sought by the legendary explorer Toma. Toma instructs the party to seek it in an island called the Giant's Claw in 600 A.D. While exploring, the party realizes that the Giant's Claw houses the Tyrano Lair -- Azala's headquarters, buried by Lavos when he impacted upon the planet. They battle his Tyrano one last time and locate the shell, employing Guardian knights for extraction. Lastly, a return to 1000 A.D. finds the King Guardia of that era under trial for selling the Rainbow Shell. The party locate the shell deep within its treasury, and eventually prove that the evidence presented by the Chancellors prosecution is false. The Chancellor reveals himself to be Yakra XIII, whose ancestor abducted Queen Leene in 600 A.D. The party defeats Yakra XIII, resulting in the ending of Marle's dispute with her father and the construction of unbelievably powerful weapons, done by Melchior using the Sun Stone and Rainbow Shell together.\n\nThe Final Battle\n\nNearing the end of their quest, the party enter the Black Omen and battle in its corridors to reach Queen Zeal. She contends in a fickle manner at first, and later tosses the party into the Mammon Machine (how this is possible even after the Mammon Machine's apparent destruction is explained in the forthcoming Lavos article). After destroying it, the party encounters Queen Zeal atop the Black Omen. Defeating her leads to a confrontation with Lavos; the party bravely fights the parasite, eventually destroying its outward functioning organs. Crono and his team enter the shell to find an alien creature within that has collected the DNA of all creatures on the planet. Concluding that Lavos has cultured the growth and evolution of the human race for his own biological gain (elaborated in Cross -- see 3000000 B.C.), the party battle once more. Following this, Lavos morphs into his true form, derived from the best possible combination of the gathered DNA. He at last succumbs. The party return to 1000 A.D., where King Guardia jests that Crono still must face execution. It is then revealed that he has been informed of the valiant quest of Crono, and the party are celebrated in the last day of the Millennial Fair. Lucca remarks that the Entity is now at rest, and each guest and party remember returns to their own era. Before the Gates close due to their purposes removal (that of existing to allow the travelers to defeat Lavos), Crono's mother and cats enter the Telepod Gate. Crono, Marle, and Lucca use the Epoch to locate her.

The adventure that ensues soon unveils an evil force set to destroy the world, triggering Crono's race against time to change the course of history and bring about a brighter future.\n\nCrono Meets Marle\n\nIn 1000 A.D., a teenager named Crono from Truce attends a fair made to celebrate 1000 years since the Kingdom of Guardia's founding. While at the fair, he meets Princess Nadia, or Marle, who is the immediate heir to Guardia. Crono and Marle participate in a demonstration of Crono's friend Lucca's teleportation device; a reaction between it and Marle's pendant, handed down for generations, causes a time Gate to open and transport Marle to 600 A.D., the middle ages. Crono immediately follows using the pendant, and discovers that Marle has been mistaken for the Queen of Guardia of that era (Queen Leene had been missing prior to Marle's entrance, and the search party mistook Marle for her). While visiting Marle, Crono watches her vanish; Lucca, after entering the area via a Gate Key (device that can open Gates), explains that Marle's ancestors never being found causes this (On a side note, Lucca is almost surely wrong here, as her explanation contradicts all other instances of temporal transforms in the Chrono series. Marle's detainment was most likely an action done by the Entity to start Crono on his quest). Crono, Lucca, and a knight who is in the form of a frog together rescue Queen Leene; subsequently, Marle reappears in Guardia castle. Crono, Marle, and Lucca depart for 1000 A.D.\n\nLavos is Discovered\n\nLucca immediately heads home, while Crono is instructed to take Marle home to Guardia Castle. Once arrived, Crono is charged with kidnapping the princess and placed on trial. He is found either guilty or not guilty, and sentenced to three days solitary confinement with possibility of execution. With the aid of Lucca, Crono breaks out of jail and battles the Chancellor of Guardia; after winning the fight, Marle joins the party and the trio escape into Guardia Forest. Cornered, they duck into a Gate in a meadow nearby. It speedily warps them to 2300 A.D., in which a battered, ruined world exists. Curious of that era, the trio trek to various futuristic domes and flattened cities (called Labs) and eventually ascertain from a video recording that a giant being, called Lavos, that hibernates beneath the planet (more on this in the forthcoming Lavos article) surfaced in 1999 A.D. and destroyed the entire world. Unwilling to let this pass, Crono's party swear to battle Lavos. While journeying in 2300 A.D., they meet a damaged humanoid robot. Lucca repairs the mechanical man, named Robo, and attempts to return home through a Gate in the Proto Dome, in which Robo was located. A door blocks the way, causing Crono, Robo, and either Lucca or Marle to venture to a nearby factory to restore power to the deactivated doorway. The party then goes through the Gate.\n\nThe End of Time\n\nDue to the Conservation of Time Theorem (see the article Principles of Time and Dimensional Travel), Crono, Marle, Lucca and Robo end up at the End of Time, which is presided over by an old man. The man gives a bit of hope to the party, who are eager to defeat Lavos; before leaving, Crono and friends visit Spekkio, the so-called 'God of War' who also lives with the old man at the end of time. Spekkio imbues each member with magic ability, and afterward provides magic to new members (for the tech of this process, see the forthcoming article on Magic). All Gates connect to the End of Time, the old man states. The party then leaves through a Gate that takes them to 1000 A.D., but to a continent other than the one in which the Kingdom of Guardia is located. The party enters Medina, the town of the Mystics, a race of warlocks and monsters that warred with the humans in 600 A.D. under the leadership of the mage known as Magus. The party must battle a Heckran monster to return to Guardia, and during his final speech the party learns that Magus supposedly created Lavos in 600 A.D. Crono's party then travels to 600 A.D., and finds the Kingdom of Guardia under serious attack. After warding off the Mystics on Zenan Bridge, they learn that a special sword, the Masamune, is capable of defeating Magus. They ascend the Denadoro Mountains to retrieve the swords, and do battle with spirits residual in the blade. After winning, Crono receives a broken piece.\n\nReconstructing the Masamune\n\nThe party then visits the abode of Frog, the knight who helped them save Queen Leene. They receive from him the other piece of the Masamune. In order to repair the blade, the party seeks Melchior, a smith that lives in 1000 A.D. He instructs the party to find Dreamstone, the material used to forge the sword. The party travels to 65,000,000 B.C. and learns that the chief of a village of humans (Ioka Village) engaged in war with a race of sentient beings half-dinosaur, half-human has the mineral in question. Ayla meets the party instantly by fending off Reptites, and invites Crono to a party. By successfully drinking more soup than Ayla, Crono receives the Dreamstone. However, the Reptites undertake a midnight raid on the villagers, stealing the Gate Key. Kino, Ayla's mate, stole the Gate Key out of jealousy for Crono's party, but later surrendered it to the Reptite raiders. Crono's party seeks out the item in question by infiltrating a Reptite hideout within a forest; on this journey, they encounter the Reptite leader, Azala, and coax her forcefully into giving up the Gate Key. Afterwards, the party returns to 1000 A.D. and has Melchior repair the sword. After having it taken to him in 600 A.D., Frog joins the party to avenge the death of his best friend, Cyrus, who fell to Magus in 590 A.D. (It is revealed in a flashback that the squire Glenn was turned into Frog in that event as well). Together, they sojourn to Magus' Lair, and defeat his top knights -- Ozzie, Slash, and Flea. After battling with Magus himself, the party and Magus are devoured by an unfathomably huge time warp caused by the summoning of Lavos he had begun prior to fighting the party. Also, it is here revealed that Magus merely summoned Lavos, and that the notion that he created the beast is false.\n\nThe Magical Kingdom\n\nThe party is thrown to 65,000,000 B.C., while Magus is catapulted to 12,000 B.C., the dark ages. After a Reptite attack demolishes the village of Laruba and concludes with the capture of Kino and other villagers, Ayla and Crono's party opt for a direct assault on the stronghold of the Reptites. After a lengthy battle to Azala's quarters, a fight ensues in which Azala is defeated and his Tyrano defender squelched. Lavos descends at this point (note: Azala did not summon him), pushing Azala's fortress far underground. Crono's party decides to fight Lavos immediately, as he would be weak, having just landed. The party finds a Gate at the impact point, and enters it to reach 12,000 B.C., a time beleaguered by an ice age brought about by Lavos' impact upon the planet. While there, the party finds a teleporation center that leads them to the ancient kingdom of Zeal, composed of several islands floating in the sky, and housing tomes on magic and various elemental sources of power. The party travels through Enhasa, city of sleep (in which a child-prince informs the party that one among them will soon perish), Kajar, city of magic, and lastly reaches Zeal Palace. Here they observe the Mammon Machine, which is used to extract energy from Lavos. Plans for the moving of the machine to a palace under the ocean surface are announced, and the party later battles the evil queen of Zeal, who is aided by a prophet. Schala, sister of the child-prince Janus mentioned above, pleads with the prophet and successfully brings about the sparing of the party. Crono and team are banished from the era, and the Gate by which they came is sealed.\n\nThe Ocean Palace\n\nAt the End of Time, the old man informs the party that a sage in 2300 A.D. was working on a machine that could travel through time. Crono forthwith enters that era, and receives the Epoch from the sage -- albeit his passing away and memories containment in a being known as the Nu. The party returns to 12,000 B.C. via this machine, and explores a cave that houses members of the human race that cannot use magic (called Earthbound) -- as opposed to the magic-users of Zeal. They notify the party of a guru of Zeal's banishment to a floating mountain nearby, and the group departs to this landform to rescue the man. After defeating a guardian, they find the man Melchior (which later elaborates on a peculiarity of the game -- this will be explained at the North Cape). Melchior recognizes that the moving of the Mammon Machine to the undersea palace will result in ruin, and gives the party a Ruby Knife (later becoming the Masamune in the grand scheme of time) to destroy the Mammon Machine with. Schala enters briefly, but is abducted by the Queen's aide, Dalton. Crono and his team use a Skygate at Zeal Palace to infiltrate the Ocean Palace, and battle their way to the grand hall in which the machine is interred. Crono thrusts the knife into the Mammon Machine, but Schala reveals that this shall have no effect. Lavos, awoken by the machines draining effects, appears (this and other phenomena are explained in the forthcoming Lavos article).\n\nThe New World\n\nThe prophet immediately reveals himself to be Magus, and tries to defeat Lavos. He cannot; Queen Zeal stands atop Lavos and the creature begins sucking Magus and Schala towards his maw. Crono bravely sacrifices himself; before the Ocean Palace collapses, Schala transports the remaining party members and Magus out to the main continent (note that what transpires in the Palace after this moment is directly responsible for the whole of Chrono Cross's plot). Lavos annihilates Zeal afterward, causing a tidal wave to engulf most of the land. Magus and Crono's party awaken to find that the Earthbound (those who cannot use magic) have left their cave and are mingling with survivors from Zeal in a place called Last Village. While conversing with the Elder, the party suffers an attack from Dalton, Queen Zeal's former aide. The party is detained upon a flying ship known as the Blackbird, built by the guru Belthasar. Dalton has stolen the Epoch as well, and orders the construction of wings and a flying system complete with weapons. The party manages to escape from prison and battle Dalton; they regain control of the Epoch afterward, and accidentally shoot down the Blackbird. After returning to the ground, the party finds Magus gazing across the sea from the North Cape of the remaining land. Magus reveals that he was Janus, and that he lived only to seek revenge on Lavos. Also revealed is that Melchior, Gaspar (the old man at the End of Time), and Belthasar (builder of the Epoch), the three gurus of Zeal, were originally scattered across time by the Ocean Palace incident that occurred before Crono intervened in time (a villager later remarks that this timelines Melchior and Janus disappeared involuntarily, confirming that they are preserved in history). Magus joins the party, and offers hope for reviving Crono. While leaving the era, they witness the rise of the Ocean Palace into the air, which is now called the Black Omen and is ruled by Queen Zeal.\n\nThe Salvation of Crono\n\nThe party return to the End of Time, where the old man (Gaspar) declares that Crono can be revived by the use of a device called the Chrono Trigger, or Time Egg. In order to do this, however, the party must have a clone of Crono to replace him with. The party travel to 1000 A.D., and at the Millennial Fair, acquire a clone of Crono. They then sojourn to 2300 A.D. as instructed by Gaspar, consulting the memory of Belthasar for instructions on reviving Crono. The party is told to climb Death Peak, a geological formation caused by the eruption of Lavos in 1999 A.D. and the breeding ground of Lavos. At the peak of the mountain, the Chrono Trigger shatters and transports the party to the instant before Crono's death in the Ocean Palace. His body is swapped with the clone, and Crono is extracted to Death Peak. Upon returning to the End of Time, the party are given knowledge by Gaspar of several sidequests that will empower it against Lavos. Firstly, the party ventures to 600 A.D. to restore a forest ruined by one of Magus' creations or associated Mystic monsters known as Retinite. The party enter the desert that is encroaching upon Fiona's Forest, and defeat the beast. Robo decides to stay and till the land for 400 years. After picking him up in 1000 A.D., the party camp in the forest, and have a discussion involving the quest. It is here that Robo proposes the existence of an Entity that shaped the quest of Chrono Trigger in order to destroy Lavos (said Entity is most likely the planet; see the forthcoming Entity article). After the discussion, Lucca finds a special Gate that allows her one chance to save her mother from losing her legs in 990 A.D.\n\nSeveral Sidequests\n\nFollowing this quest, the party and Magus decimate Ozzie, Slash, and Flea's hideout in 600 A.D., eradicating hatred towards humans by the Mystics in 1000 A.D. Next, the party discovers that a crazed AI is exterminating humans on an island in 2300 A.D. Robo is revealed to have originated in the islands facility, and told his purpose was to watch humans. A female robot called Atropos attempts to destroy him due to her brainwashing by the crazed AI (known as Mother Brain). Robo succeeds in fending her off, and eventually defeats Mother Brain -- receiving his greatest weapons in the process.

(it rose off the ocean floor apparently) and locate the Sun Stone. Recognizing that its power has left it, the party deposits it in 65,000,000 B.C. to charge. Finding it stolen by the Porre mayor in 1000 A.D., they instill kindness in the Porre leaderships family by giving free jerky to the Elder's wife in 600 A.D. After the Sun Stone is returned to them by a benevolent mayor in 1000 A.D., it is fully charged by 2300 A.D. and used to make useful items by Lucca.\n\nThe Royal Family\n\nOnce this quest is complete, the party, with Frog, venture to 1000 A.D. to find that Cyrus, the fallen knight and friend of Frog, is restless and haunting his gravesite. Through hiring carpenters, the party repairs the gravesite, locate powerful weapons and armor, and make peace with Cyrus -- resulting in a boost in the power of the Masamune. Following this, the party decide to look for the Rainbow Shell, a priceless mineral formation sought by the legendary explorer Toma. Toma instructs the party to seek it in an island called the Giant's Claw in 600 A.D. While exploring, the party realizes that the Giant's Claw houses the Tyrano Lair -- Azala's headquarters, buried by Lavos when he impacted upon the planet. They battle his Tyrano one last time and locate the shell, employing Guardian knights for extraction. Lastly, a return to 1000 A.D. finds the King Guardia of that era under trial for selling the Rainbow Shell. The party locate the shell deep within its treasury, and eventually prove that the evidence presented by the Chancellors prosecution is false. The Chancellor reveals himself to be Yakra XIII, whose ancestor abducted Queen Leene in 600 A.D. The party defeats Yakra XIII, resulting in the ending of Marle's dispute with her father and the construction of unbelievably powerful weapons, done by Melchior using the Sun Stone and Rainbow Shell together.\n\nThe Final Battle\n\nNearing the end of their quest, the party enter the Black Omen and battle in its corridors to reach Queen Zeal.

Crono bravely sacrifices himself; before the Ocean Palace collapses, Schala transports the remaining party members and Magus out to the main continent (note that what transpires in the Palace after this moment is directly responsible for the whole of Chrono Cross's plot). Lavos annihilates Zeal afterward, causing a tidal wave to engulf most of the land. Magus and Crono's party awaken to find that the Earthbound (those who cannot use magic) have left their cave and are mingling with survivors from Zeal in a place called Last Village. While conversing with the Elder, the party suffers an attack from Dalton, Queen Zeal's former aide. The party is detained upon a flying ship known as the Blackbird, built by the guru Belthasar. Dalton has stolen the Epoch as well, and orders the construction of wings and a flying system complete with weapons. The party manages to escape from prison and battle Dalton; they regain control of the Epoch afterward, and accidentally shoot down the Blackbird. After returning to the ground, the party finds Magus gazing across the sea from the North Cape of the remaining land. Magus reveals that he was Janus, and that he lived only to seek revenge on Lavos. Also revealed is that Melchior, Gaspar (the old man at the End of Time), and Belthasar (builder of the Epoch), the three gurus of Zeal, were originally scattered across time by the Ocean Palace incident that occurred before Crono intervened in time (a villager later remarks that this timelines Melchior and Janus disappeared involuntarily, confirming that they are preserved in history). Magus joins the party, and offers hope for reviving Crono. While leaving the era, they witness the rise of the Ocean Palace into the air, which is now called the Black Omen and is ruled by Queen Zeal.\n\nThe Salvation of Crono\n\nThe party return to the End of Time, where the old man (Gaspar) declares that Crono can be revived by the use of a device called the Chrono Trigger, or Time Egg. In order to do this, however, the party must have a clone of Crono to replace him with. The party travel to 1000 A.D., and at the Millennial Fair, acquire a clone of Crono. They then sojourn to 2300 A.D. as instructed by Gaspar, consulting the memory of Belthasar for instructions on reviving Crono. The party is told to climb Death Peak, a geological formation caused by the eruption of Lavos in 1999 A.D. and the breeding ground of Lavos. At the peak of the mountain, the Chrono Trigger shatters and transports the party to the instant before Crono's death in the Ocean Palace. His body is swapped with the clone, and Crono is extracted to Death Peak. Upon returning to the End of Time, the party are given knowledge by Gaspar of several sidequests that will empower it against Lavos. Firstly, the party ventures to 600 A.D. to restore a forest ruined by one of Magus' creations or associated Mystic monsters known as Retinite. The party enter the desert that is encroaching upon Fiona's Forest, and defeat the beast. Robo decides to stay and till the land for 400 years. After picking him up in 1000 A.D., the party camp in the forest, and have a discussion involving the quest. It is here that Robo proposes the existence of an Entity that shaped the quest of Chrono Trigger in order to destroy Lavos (said Entity is most likely the planet; see the forthcoming Entity article). After the discussion, Lucca finds a special Gate that allows her one chance to save her mother from losing her legs in 990 A.D.\n\nSeveral Sidequests\n\nFollowing this quest, the party and Magus decimate Ozzie, Slash, and Flea's hideout in 600 A.D., eradicating hatred towards humans by the Mystics in 1000 A.D. Next, the party discovers that a crazed AI is exterminating humans on an island in 2300 A.D. Robo is revealed to have originated in the islands facility, and told his purpose was to watch humans. A female robot called Atropos attempts to destroy him due to her brainwashing by the crazed AI (known as Mother Brain). Robo succeeds in fending her off, and eventually defeats Mother Brain -- receiving his greatest weapons in the process. Following this event, the party search for the Sun Stone, a stone charged with solar energy that once powered Zeal. They defeat a monster called the Son of Sun in the Sun Temple of Zeal in 2300 A.D. (it rose off the ocean floor apparently) and locate the Sun Stone. Recognizing that its power has left it, the party deposits it in 65,000,000 B.C. to charge. Finding it stolen by the Porre mayor in 1000 A.D., they instill kindness in the Porre leaderships family by giving free jerky to the Elder's wife in 600 A.D. After the Sun Stone is returned to them by a benevolent mayor in 1000 A.D., it is fully charged by 2300 A.D. and used to make useful items by Lucca.\n\nThe Royal Family\n\nOnce this quest is complete, the party, with Frog, venture to 1000 A.D. to find that Cyrus, the fallen knight and friend of Frog, is restless and haunting his gravesite. Through hiring carpenters, the party repairs the gravesite, locate powerful weapons and armor, and make peace with Cyrus -- resulting in a boost in the power of the Masamune. Following this, the party decide to look for the Rainbow Shell, a priceless mineral formation sought by the legendary explorer Toma. Toma instructs the party to seek it in an island called the Giant's Claw in 600 A.D. While exploring, the party realizes that the Giant's Claw houses the Tyrano Lair -- Azala's headquarters, buried by Lavos when he impacted upon the planet. They battle his Tyrano one last time and locate the shell, employing Guardian knights for extraction. Lastly, a return to 1000 A.D. finds the King Guardia of that era under trial for selling the Rainbow Shell. The party locate the shell deep within its treasury, and eventually prove that the evidence presented by the Chancellors prosecution is false. The Chancellor reveals himself to be Yakra XIII, whose ancestor abducted Queen Leene in 600 A.D. The party defeats Yakra XIII, resulting in the ending of Marle's dispute with her father and the construction of unbelievably powerful weapons, done by Melchior using the Sun Stone and Rainbow Shell together.\n\nThe Final Battle\n\nNearing the end of their quest, the party enter the Black Omen and battle in its corridors to reach Queen Zeal. She contends in a fickle manner at first, and later tosses the party into the Mammon Machine (how this is possible even after the Mammon Machine's apparent destruction is explained in the forthcoming Lavos article). After destroying it, the party encounters Queen Zeal atop the Black Omen. Defeating her leads to a confrontation with Lavos; the party bravely fights the parasite, eventually destroying its outward functioning organs. Crono and his team enter the shell to find an alien creature within that has collected the DNA of all creatures on the planet. Concluding that Lavos has cultured the growth and evolution of the human race for his own biological gain (elaborated in Cross -- see 3000000 B.C.), the party battle once more. Following this, Lavos morphs into his true form, derived from the best possible combination of the gathered DNA. He at last succumbs. The party return to 1000 A.D., where King Guardia jests that Crono still must face execution. It is then revealed that he has been informed of the valiant quest of Crono, and the party are celebrated in the last day of the Millennial Fair. Lucca remarks that the Entity is now at rest, and each guest and party remember returns to their own era. Before the Gates close due to their purposes removal (that of existing to allow the travelers to defeat Lavos), Crono's mother and cats enter the Telepod Gate. Crono, Marle, and Lucca use the Epoch to locate her.

 Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.\n \n  You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. \n   Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions.\n   Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more.\n   Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.\n   Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others.\n   Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines.\n   Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials.\n   Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.\n   Trade with passing ships and caravans.\n   Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony.\n   Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.\n   Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.\n   Discover a new generated world each time you play.\n   Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop.\n   Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.  \n  RimWorld is a story generator.  It\u2019s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the \u201crandom\u201d events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the  AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.\n \n  Your colonists are not professional settlers  \u2013 they\u2019re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You\u2019ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.\n \n  Each person\u2019s background is tracked and affects how they play.  A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \u2013 but he does that very well.\n \n  Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.  Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.\n \n  The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.  You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.\n \n  Travel across the planet.  You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.\n \n  You can tame and train animals.  Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.\n \n  People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.  They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.\n \n  Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.  Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.\n \n  You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.  A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.\n \n And there's much more than that!

Puedes elegir si aterrizar tus c\u00e1psulas de escape en una fr\u00eda tundra al norte, una planicie en el desierto, un bosque templado, o una c\u00e1lida jungla en el ecuador. Cada \u00e1rea cuenta con animales, plantas, enfermedades, temperaturas, lluvias, recursos minerales y terrenos distintos. Los retos para sobrevivir en una jungla caliente llena de enfermedades son muy distintos a estar en un desierto \u00e1rido o una tundra congelada con una temporada de cosecha de tan s\u00f3lo dos meses.\n \n  Recorre todo el planeta.  No tienes porqu\u00e9 quedarte atrapado en un s\u00f3lo lugar. Podr\u00e1s formar caravanas de personas, animales y prisioneros.

Apprenez \u00e0 jouer facilement avec l\u2019aide d\u2019un mentor IA intelligent et discret.\n \n RimWorld est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par Tynan Sylvester et Ludeon Studios, et nous avons toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 en cours d\u2019am\u00e9liorations depuis le premier lancement public le 4 novembre 2013. Le raconteur IA \n  RimWorld n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour \u00eatre un jeu de strat\u00e9gie comp\u00e9titif, mais pour \u00eatre un g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur d\u2019histoires.  Le but n\u2019est pas de gagner ou de perdre, le but est le drame, les trag\u00e9dies, et la com\u00e9die qui se d\u00e9roulent dans la colonie. Le jeu cr\u00e9e des \u00e9v\u00e8nements comme des incursions de pirates, l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de marchands, et les temp\u00eates. Cependant, ces \u00e9v\u00e8nements ne sont pas al\u00e9atoires. RimWorld utilise le raconteur IA (inspir\u00e9 par le directeur IA de Left 4 Dead) qui analyse votre situation et d\u00e9cide quel \u00e9v\u00e8nement produira la meilleure histoire.\n \n Il y a trois raconteurs desquels vous pouvez choisir : le rythme mod\u00e9r\u00e9 de Cassandra Classic, le rythme plus lent, et appropri\u00e9 pour la construction, de Phoebe Chillax, et l\u2019impr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 totale de Randy Random. Une dr\u00f4le de bande \n  Dans RimWorld, vos colons ne sont pas des colonisateurs professionnels  \u2013 ils sont les survivants d\u2019un \u00e9crasement de vaisseau spatial. Ils seront des comptables, des femmes de foyer, des journalistes, des cuisiniers, des nobles, des va-nu-pieds, ou des soldats.\n \n Un noble aura des habilet\u00e9s sociales excellentes (pour le recrutement des prisonniers ou la n\u00e9gociation des prix de commerce), mais il refusera tout travail physique. Le lourdaud sait comment produire la nourriture, mais il ne peut faire de la recherche. Un scientifique est ais\u00e9 \u00e0 la recherche, mais il ne pourra entreprendre aucune t\u00e2che sociale. Un assassin modifi\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9tiquement peut seulement tuer, mais il fait ceci tr\u00e8s bien.\n \n  Chaque personnage a des traits de personnalit\u00e9.  Les colons n\u00e9vros\u00e9s travaillent plus rapidement, mais ils sont plus stress\u00e9s et pr\u00e9dispos\u00e9s aux crises de nerfs. Les personnages abrasifs interagiront nuisiblement et endommageront l\u2019humeur des autres. Un nudiste aime \u00eatre nu et un cannibale devient surexcit\u00e9 lors de la consommation de la chaire humaine.\n \n  Vous obtiendrez plus de colons  en acceptant des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, en capturant des personnes au combat pour les recruter \u00e0 votre cause, en les achetant par des marchands d\u2019esclaves, en les sauvant, ou en acceptant les migrants. Mod\u00e9lisation de la sant\u00e9 \n  Les blessures, les infections, les proth\u00e8ses, et les conditions chroniques de chaque partie du corps de chaque personnage sont suivies et ont un impact sur leurs capacit\u00e9s.  Une blessure \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153il rend le tire de pr\u00e9cision et les chirurgies plus difficiles. Les mains, le cerveau, la bouche, le c\u0153ur, le foie, les reins, l\u2019estomac, les pieds, les doigts, les orteils, et plus peuvent \u00eatre bless\u00e9s, malades ou manquants, et ils auront tous un impact logique sur le fonctionnement du personnage. Les autres esp\u00e8ces auront des dispositions corporelles diff\u00e9rentes. Enlevez la patte d\u2019un chevreuil et il peut encore courir avec les trois autres!\n \n  Vous pouvez r\u00e9parer les parties du corps avec des proth\u00e8ses allant de primitif \u00e0 transcendant.  Une jambe de bois permettra \u00e0 Jean Colon de marcher suite \u00e0 un incident malheureux avec un rhinoc\u00e9ros, mais il demeurera assez lent. Achetez une jambe bionique co\u00fbteuse d\u2019un marchand la prochaine ann\u00e9e, et Jean devient un coureur d\u2019une vitesse surhumaine. Vous pouvez m\u00eame extraire, vendre, acheter, et greffer les organes. \n \n Les maladies sont une menace s\u00e9rieuse. Les lac\u00e9rations ouvertes deviendront infect\u00e9es. La grippe et la peste peuvent appara\u00eetre n\u2019importe o\u00f9, mais la malaria et la maladie du sommeil sont seulement retrouv\u00e9es dans les for\u00eats tropicales. Lorsque les colons vieillissent, ils peuvent d\u00e9velopper des conditions chroniques telles que des cataractes ou des maux de dos. La temp\u00e9rature et les saisons \n  La temp\u00e9rature est model\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des b\u00e2timents aussi bien qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur.  Avec la progression des saisons, la temp\u00e9rature \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur augmentera et diminuera. Les plantes peuvent seulement cro\u00eetre pendant certaines temp\u00e9ratures. Quand il deviendra froid, il neigera. Les personnages pourront d\u00e9velopper l\u2019hypothermie ou ils peuvent avoir un coup de chaleur.\n \n Vous pouvez contr\u00f4ler les temp\u00e9ratures \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des abris avec du chauffage ou de l\u2019air climatis\u00e9 pour faciliter la survie, le confort, ou pr\u00e9venir la d\u00e9composition de la nourriture. Vous pouvez m\u00eame fabriquer des pi\u00e8ges de temp\u00e9ratures mortellement chaudes pour cuire vos ennemis vivants. G\u00e9n\u00e9ration des plan\u00e8tes et biomes \n  Le jeu g\u00e9n\u00e8re une plan\u00e8te au complet, des p\u00f4les \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quateur.  Vous pouvez choisir d\u2019atterrir votre capsule de sauvetage sur une toundra nordique froide, une plaine d\u00e9sertique assoiff\u00e9e, une for\u00eat temp\u00e9r\u00e9e, ou une jungle \u00e9quatoriale \u00e9touffante. \n \n  Les r\u00e9gions diff\u00e9rentes ont des animaux, des plantes, des maladies, des temp\u00e9ratures, des niveaux de pr\u00e9cipitation, des min\u00e9raux, et des terrains diff\u00e9rents.  Les d\u00e9fis pour survivre une jungle \u00e9touffante et infest\u00e9e de maladie sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rents de ceux dans la d\u00e9solation d\u2019un d\u00e9sert assoiff\u00e9e ou une toundra avec une saison agricole de deux mois. Le moteur \u00e0 tactique \n  RimWorld utilise un moteur que nous avons initialement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 pour un simulateur de combat tactique  similaire \u00e0 Jagged Alliance 2. Ceci signifie qu\u2019il a beaucoup de caract\u00e9ristiques con\u00e7ues pour rendre plus int\u00e9ressants les combats arm\u00e9s en petites \u00e9quipes. Par exemple : \n \n   Il y a un syst\u00e8me mod\u00e9lisant les diff\u00e9rents types de protection par abri lors de fusillades.\n   Il y a un algorithme nuanc\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer et rapporter la probabilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre touch\u00e9 d\u2019une balle, se basant sur la distance, le niveau d\u2019habilet\u00e9, l\u2019arme utilis\u00e9e, la luminosit\u00e9 des environs, l\u2019angle du tireur et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de l\u2019abri pris par la personne vis\u00e9e. \n   Les armes ont des statistiques assez profondes.\n   L\u2019IA planifie et ex\u00e9cute des mouvements tactiques tels que le flanquement en essayant de d\u00e9tourner la ligne de mire de l\u2019ennemi. Il utilise certains algorithmes heuristiques pour analyser le champ de bataille pour utiliser l\u2019espace efficacement. Il fonctionne avec les alli\u00e9s pour \u00e9viter de cr\u00e9er un peloton.    \n En raison de l\u2019importance de l\u2019abri et du positionnement pendant les fusillades, le combat interagit \u00e0 un niveau profond avec la disposition et la structure de la colonie. Alors vous devez r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir pour d\u00e9terminer quelles constructions seraient \u00e0 votre avantage lors des combats arm\u00e9s. De plus, il est possible de construire une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de configurations de base pour obtenir un avantage tactique maximal contre diff\u00e9rents adversaires. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, le combat g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 est plus int\u00e9ressant que l\u2019\u00e9change coup pour coup auquel vous vous attendez normalement dans les jeux traditionnels de construction de base. Le syst\u00e8me d\u2019enseignement \n  Ce type de jeu peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 apprendre.  Alors, nous avons cr\u00e9\u00e9 un syst\u00e8me d\u2019enseignement adaptatif qui observe vos actions pour tenter de d\u00e9terminer quelles parties du jeu vous comprenez, et vous enseigner les parties que vous avez manqu\u00e9es. Si vous ne comprenez pas un contr\u00f4le, le jeu s\u2019en apercevra et vous aidera discr\u00e8tement. Si vous comprenez d\u00e9j\u00e0 un principe, le jeu ne vous interrompra pas. \n \n  RimWorld utilise aussi un syst\u00e8me d\u2019avertissement pour s\u2019assurer que vous ne manquez rien qui m\u00e9rite votre attention.  S\u2019il y a peu de nourriture, o\u00f9 un colon se d\u00e9cha\u00eenera sous peu, un message flottera dans le coin de l\u2019\u00e9cran pour vous aviser. La colonie ne pourra plus \u00eatre an\u00e9antie parce que vous avez manqu\u00e9 un petit d\u00e9tail. Si vous \u00eates an\u00e9anti, ce sera pour une raison compl\u00e8tement l\u00e9gitime. Psychologie \n  Les personnages de RimWorld observent \u00e0 tous moments leurs situations et leurs environnements pour d\u00e9terminer comment ils se sentent.  Ils r\u00e9agissent \u00e0 la faim et la fatigue, l\u2019observation d\u2019un d\u00e9c\u00e8s, les d\u00e9pouilles non ensevelies, aux blessures, \u00e0 la noirceur, aux pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 espace restreint, au sommeil \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur ou dans la m\u00eame pi\u00e8ce que d\u2019autres personnes, et plusieurs autres situations. Vous pouvez inspecter la psychologie d\u2019un personnage \u00e0 tous moments pour d\u00e9terminer comment il se sent et pourquoi.\n \n  Quand un colon devient trop stress\u00e9, il peut faire une crise de nerfs.  Certains abandonneront la colonie et erreront pour un certain temps. Certains partiront. Et certains, dans le style de Dwarf Fortress, certains peuvent devenir psychotiques et piqueront une crise violente et meurtri\u00e8re. L\u2019univers \n  Le gendre de RimWorld est un m\u00e9lange de la hard science-fiction le Far West.  C\u2019est un monde au bord de l\u2019espace connu, loin de la civilisation des plan\u00e8tes centrales. La plan\u00e8te est vaste et presque enti\u00e8rement vide et il n\u2019y a pas de forte autorit\u00e9 dans les environs. Vous \u00eates laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 vous d\u00e9brouiller seul. \n \n  L\u2019id\u00e9e centrale de l\u2019univers de RimWorld est la diversit\u00e9 des exp\u00e9riences humaines.  Dans ce contexte, l\u2019humanit\u00e9 est \u00e9tendue \u00e0 travers la galaxie, pourtant ils n\u2019ont aucun moyen de voyager ou communiquer plus rapidement que la lumi\u00e8re. Combinez ceci au fait que les civilisations stellaires r\u00e9gressent (en raison des guerres ou d\u2019\u00e9pid\u00e9mies) aussi souvent qu\u2019ils progressent, alors une personne voyageant entre les \u00e9toiles peut interagir avec d\u2019autres personnes \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel autre niveau de d\u00e9veloppement, des tribus pr\u00e9 agriculturales \u00e0 des dieux-machines transcendants. \n \n Vous amorcez RimWorld avec des colons qui sont \u00e0 un niveau technologique au milieu du spectre. Cependant, vous pouvez potentiellement interagir avec des personnages \u00e0 un niveau bien inf\u00e9rieur ou sup\u00e9rieur au v\u00f4tre, et aussi bien acqu\u00e9rir et utiliser leurs outils et armes. Dans RimWorld, un arc et fl\u00e8che, un fusil de chasse, un fusil \u00e0 charge pulsatile et une machine meurtri\u00e8re biom\u00e9canique peuvent tous prendre par dans une seule bagarre."}, {"lang": "de", "text": " RimWorld ist eine Science-Fiction-Kolonie-Simulation, die von einer intelligenten Erz\u00e4hler-KI gelenkt wird.  Ma\u00dfgebliche Inspirationen sind Dwarf Fortress, Firefly und Dune.\n \n  Du beginnst mit drei \u00dcberlebenden, die gerade auf einem fernen Planeten notgelandet sind. \n \n   K\u00fcmmere dich um die Stimmungen, Bed\u00fcrfnisse, Wunden, Krankheiten und Abh\u00e4ngigkeiten deiner Kolonisten.\n   Baue deine Kolonie im Wald, in der W\u00fcste, im Dschungel, in der Tundra und mehr.\n   Beobachte, wie deine Kolonisten ihre Beziehungen zu Verwandten, Liebhabern und Ehepartnern vertiefen oder beenden.\n   Ersetze verletzte Gliedma\u00dfen und Organe durch Prothesen, bionische Teile oder biologische Teile, die du von anderen Menschen entnommen hast.\n   K\u00e4mpfe gegen Piraten, St\u00e4mme, verr\u00fcckte Tiere, Rieseninsekten und antike Killermaschinen.\n   Stelle Strukturen, Waffen und Kleidung aus Metall, Holz, Stein, Stoff oder futuristischen Materialien her.\n   Z\u00e4hme und trainiere niedliche Haustiere, produktive Nutztiere oder t\u00f6dliche Bestien.\n   Handle mit vorbeiziehenden Schiffen und Karawanen.\n   Erstelle Karawanen, um Quests zu erledigen, Handel zu treiben, andere Fraktionen anzugreifen oder deine ganze Kolonie umzusiedeln.\n   Grabe dich durch Schnee, \u00fcberstehe St\u00fcrme und l\u00f6sche Br\u00e4nde.\n   Fange Fl\u00fcchtlinge oder Gefangene ein, um sie zu rekrutieren oder in die Sklaverei zu verkaufen.\n   Erkunde eine zuf\u00e4llig generierte Welt.\n   Entdecke Hunderte von wilden und interessanten Mods im Steam Workshop.\n   Lerne auf einfache Weise das Spiel kennen, dank eines intelligenten und diskreten KI-Tutors.  \n  RimWorld ist ein Geschichtengenerator.  Es wurde entwickelt, um dich bei tragischen, kuriosen und triumphalen Geschichten \u00fcber eingesperrte Piraten, verzweifelte Kolonisten, Hungersn\u00f6te und \u00dcberleben mitwirken zu lassen. Das Ganze funktioniert, indem du die \"zuf\u00e4lligen\" Ereignisse ausspielst, die dir die Welt zuwirft. Jedes Gewitter, jeder Piraten\u00fcberfall und jeder reisende H\u00e4ndler ist ein von einer  Erz\u00e4hler-KI  ausgel\u00f6stes Ereignis, das Einfluss auf deine Geschichte haben wird. Es gibt mehrere Geschichtenerz\u00e4hler, aus denen du w\u00e4hlen kannst. Randy Random macht verr\u00fcckte Sachen, Cassandra Classic l\u00e4sst die Spannung kontinuierlich ansteigen und Phoebe Chillax ist eher von der ruhigen Sorte.\n \n  Deine Kolonisten sind keine erfahrenen Siedler.  Sie sind notgelandete \u00dcberlebende eines Passagierschiffs, das in der Umlaufbahn zerst\u00f6rt wurde. Es kann passieren, dass deine Geschichte mit einem Adligen, einem Buchhalter und einer Hausfrau beginnt. Um weitere Kolonisten zu erhalten, kannst du Feinde gefangen nehmen und rekrutieren, Sklavenh\u00e4ndler aufsuchen oder Fl\u00fcchtlinge bei dir aufnehmen. Deine Kolonie wird also immer eine bunte Truppe sein.\n \n  Jede Person hat eine Vorgeschichte, die ihr Verhalten bestimmt.  Ein Adliger ist gut in sozialen Dingen (z. B. beim Anwerben von Gefangenen oder Aushandeln von Preisen), weigert sich aber, k\u00f6rperliche Arbeit zu verrichten. Ein einfacher Bauer wei\u00df aus langer Erfahrung, wie man Nahrung anbaut, kann aber nicht forschen. Ein strebsamer Wissenschaftler ist als Forscher gut geeignet, kann aber keine sozialen Aufgaben \u00fcbernehmen. Ein genmanipulierter Attent\u00e4ter t\u00f6tet einfach nur \u2014 aber mit hoher Effizienz.\n \n  Kolonisten entwickeln - und zerst\u00f6ren - Beziehungen.  Jeder hat eine Meinung \u00fcber den anderen. Dies hat Einfluss darauf, ob sie ein Paar werden, heiraten, betr\u00fcgen oder sich pr\u00fcgeln. Vielleicht sind deine beiden besten Kolonisten gl\u00fccklich verheiratet \u2014 bis sich einer von ihnen in den feschen Chirurgen verliebt, der sie oder ihn vor einer Schusswunde gerettet hat.\n \n  Das Spiel generiert einen ganzen Planeten vom Pol bis zum \u00c4quator.  Du hast die Wahl, ob das Startgebiet eine kalte Tundra im Norden, eine trockene W\u00fcstenebene, ein gem\u00e4\u00dfigter Wald oder ein schw\u00fclwarmer Dschungel am \u00c4quator sein soll. Jedes Gebiet hat andere Tiere, Pflanzen, Krankheiten, Temperaturen, Niederschl\u00e4ge, Bodensch\u00e4tze und Gel\u00e4ndeformen. Das \u00dcberleben in einem krankheitsverseuchten, erstickenden Dschungel ist eine ganz andere Erfahrung als in einer trockenen W\u00fcstenebene oder einer gefrorenen Tundra mit einer zweimonatigen Wachstumsperiode.\n \n  Reise \u00fcber den ganzen Planeten.  Du bist nicht an einen Ort gebunden. Du kannst eine Karawane mit Menschen, Tieren und Gefangenen zusammenstellen. Rette entf\u00fchrte Verb\u00fcndete aus einem Piratenau\u00dfenposten, nimm an Friedensgespr\u00e4chen teil, treibe Handel mit anderen Fraktionen, greife feindliche Kolonien an und erledige andere Quests. Du kannst sogar deine gesamte Kolonie aufl\u00f6sen und an einen neuen Ort ziehen. Nutze raketenbetriebene Transportkapseln, um die Reise zu beschleunigen.\n \n  Du kannst Tiere z\u00e4hmen und trainieren.  Niedliche Haustiere k\u00f6nnen deine traurigen Kolonisten aufmuntern. Nutztiere k\u00f6nnen geschlachtet, gemolken und geschoren werden. Kampftiere k\u00f6nnen auf deine Feinde losgelassen werden. Es gibt viele Tiere: Katzen, Labrador Retriever, Grizzlyb\u00e4ren, Kamele, Pumas, Chinchillas, H\u00fchner und exotische, fremde Lebensformen.\n \n  Die Menschen in RimWorld analysieren st\u00e4ndig ihre Situation und Umgebung, was Einfluss auf ihre momentane Gef\u00fchlslage hat.  Sie reagieren unter anderem auf Hunger und M\u00fcdigkeit, auf Todesf\u00e4lle, auf nicht beerdigte Leichen, auf Verletzungen, auf Dunkelheit, auf enge R\u00e4ume, auf \u00dcbernachtungen im Freien oder darauf, ob sie ihren Schlafraum mit jemand anderem teilen m\u00fcssen. Wenn sie zu sehr gestresst sind, k\u00f6nnen sie ausrasten oder kollabieren.\n \n  Wunden, Infektionen, Prothesen und chronische Krankheiten k\u00f6nnen an jedem K\u00f6rperteil auftreten und beeinflussen die Leistungsf\u00e4higkeit der Charaktere.  Augenverletzungen erschweren das Schie\u00dfen oder eine Operation. Verwundete Beine machen Menschen langsamer. H\u00e4nde, Gehirn, Mund, Herz, Leber, Nieren, Magen, F\u00fc\u00dfe, Finger, Zehen usw. k\u00f6nnen verletzt werden, erkranken oder fehlen \u2014 all das wird sich logisch im Spiel auswirken. Andere Spezies haben ihren eigenen K\u00f6rperbau \u2014 wenn ein Hirsch eines seiner Beine verliert, kann er immer noch auf den anderen drei humpeln. Entferne das Horn eines Nashorns, und es ist viel weniger gef\u00e4hrlich.\n \n  Du kannst K\u00f6rperteile durch Prothesen ersetzen.  Ein Holzbein sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass der arme Joe nach einem ungl\u00fccklichen Zwischenfall mit einem Nashorn wieder laufen kann, auch wenn er damit nur recht langsam vorankommt. Kaufe ein Jahr sp\u00e4ter ein teures bionisches Bein von einem H\u00e4ndler ab, um Joe zu einem \u00fcbermenschlichen L\u00e4ufer zu machen. Du kannst sogar Organe entnehmen, verkaufen, kaufen und implantieren.\n \n Und es gibt noch viel mehr als das! Das Spiel ist leicht zu modifizieren und hat eine aktive Mod-Community.

Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.\n \n  You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world. \n   Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, illnesses and addictions.\n   Build in the forest, desert, jungle, tundra, and more.\n   Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.\n   Replace wounded limbs and organs with prosthetics, bionics, or biological parts harvested from others.\n   Fight pirates, tribes, mad animals, giant insects and ancient killing machines.\n   Craft structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, and futuristic materials.\n   Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.\n   Trade with passing ships and caravans.\n   Form caravans to complete quests, trade, attack other factions, or migrate your whole colony.\n   Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.\n   Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.\n   Discover a new generated world each time you play.\n   Explore hundreds of wild and interesting mods on the Steam Workshop.\n   Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.  \n  RimWorld is a story generator.  It\u2019s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the \u201crandom\u201d events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the  AI Storyteller . There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.\n \n  Your colonists are not professional settlers  \u2013 they\u2019re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You\u2019ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.\n \n  Each person\u2019s background is tracked and affects how they play.  A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \u2013 but he does that very well.\n \n  Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.  Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.\n \n  The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.  You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.\n \n  Travel across the planet.  You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.\n \n  You can tame and train animals.  Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.\n \n  People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.  They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.\n \n  Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.  Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.\n \n  You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.  A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.\n \n And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active modding community on the Steam Workshop."}, {"lang": "ja", "text": "

So your colony will always be a motley crew.\n \n  Each person\u2019s background is tracked and affects how they play.  A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \u2013 but he does that very well.\n \n  Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships.  Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.\n \n  The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator.  You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.\n \n  Travel across the planet.  You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.\n \n  You can tame and train animals.  Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.\n \n  People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment.  They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.\n \n  Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities.  Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.\n \n  You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent.  A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow.

Randy Random fa cose pazze, Cassandra Classic cerca di aumentare la tensione e Phoebe Chillax ama rilassarsi.\n \n  I tuoi coloni non sono coloni professionisti : sono sopravvissuti all'atterraggio di una nave passeggeri distrutta in orbita. Puoi finire con un nobile, un ragioniere e una casalinga. Acquisirai pi\u00f9 coloni catturandoli in combattimento e portandoli dalla tua parte, acquistandoli da commercianti di schiavi o accogliendo rifugiati. Quindi la tua colonia sar\u00e0 sempre una squadra eterogenea.\n \n  Il background di ogni persona viene monitorato e influenza il modo in cui gioca.  Un nobile sar\u00e0 bravo nelle abilit\u00e0 sociali (reclutamento di prigionieri, negoziazione dei prezzi commerciali), ma rifiuta di fare un lavoro fisico. Una fattoria oaf sa come coltivare il cibo con una lunga esperienza, ma non pu\u00f2 fare ricerca. Uno scienziato nerd \u00e8 bravo nella ricerca, ma non pu\u00f2 assolutamente svolgere compiti sociali. Un assassino geneticamente modificato non pu\u00f2 fare altro che uccidere, ma lo fa molto bene.\n \n  I coloni sviluppano - e distruggono - le relazioni.  Ognuno ha un'opinione degli altri, che determina se diventeranno amanti, si sposeranno, imbrogliano o combatteranno. Forse i tuoi due migliori coloni sono felicemente sposati, fino a quando uno di loro non si innamora del chirurgo che l'ha salvata da una ferita da arma da fuoco.\n \n  Il gioco genera un intero pianeta dal polo a equatore.  Scegli se seminare i tuoi baccelli all'improvviso in una fredda tundra settentrionale, un deserto arido, una foresta temperata o una giungla equatoriale fumante. Diverse aree hanno diversi animali, piante, malattie, temperature, precipitazioni, risorse minerali e terreno. Queste sfide per sopravvivere in una giungla soffocante infestata da malattie sono molto diverse da quelle in una desolata terra deserta del deserto o in una tundra ghiacciata con una stagione di crescita di due mesi.\n \n  Viaggia attraverso il pianeta.  Non sei bloccato in un posto. Puoi formare una roulotte di persone, animali e prigionieri. Salvare gli ex alleati rapiti dagli avamposti dei pirati, partecipare a colloqui di pace, commerciare con altre fazioni, attaccare colonie nemiche e completare altre missioni. Puoi persino impacchettare l'intera colonia e trasferirti in un nuovo posto. Puoi usare i pod di trasporto a razzo per viaggiare pi\u00f9 velocemente.\n \n  Puoi domare e addestrare gli animali.  Gli adorabili animali rallegreranno i coloni tristi. Gli animali della fattoria possono essere lavorati, munti e tosati. Le bestie d'attacco possono essere scagliate contro i tuoi nemici. Ci sono molti animali - gatti, labrador retriever, orsi grizzly, cammelli, puma, cincill\u00e0, galline e forme di vita esotiche simili ad alieni.\n \n  Le persone in RimWorld osservano costantemente la loro situazione e l'ambiente circostante per decidere come sentirsi in un dato momento.  Rispondono alla fame e alla fatica, assistono alla morte, ai cadaveri irrispettosamente non feriti, vengono feriti, lasciati nell'oscurit\u00e0, sono stipati in ambienti angusti, dormono fuori o nella stessa stanza degli altri e in molte altre situazioni. Se sono troppo stressati, potrebbero stare male o ribellarsi.\n \n  Ferite, infezioni, protesi e condizioni croniche vengono tracciate su ogni parte del corpo e influenzano le capacit\u00e0 dei personaggi.  Le lesioni agli occhi rendono difficile sparare o eseguire un intervento chirurgico. Le gambe ferite rallentano le persone. Mani, cervello, bocca, cuore, fegato, reni, stomaco, piedi, dita, dita dei piedi e altro possono essere tutti feriti, malati o mancanti e tutti hanno effetti logici nel gioco. E altre specie hanno il proprio corredo corporeo: togliti una zampa di cervo e pu\u00f2 ancora camminare zoppicando sulle altre tre. Togliti il \u200b\u200bcorno di un rinoceronte ed \u00e8 molto meno pericoloso.\n \n  Puoi riparare parti del corpo con protesi che vanno da primitive a trascendenti.  Una gamba di legno far\u00e0 camminare Joe Colonist dopo uno sfortunato incidente con un rinoceronte, ma sar\u00e0 comunque piuttosto lento. Acquista una costosa gamba bionica da un commerciante l'anno successivo e Joe diventa un corridore sovrumano. Puoi persino estrarre, vendere, acquistare e trapiantare organi interni.\n \n E c'\u00e8 molto di pi\u00f9! Il gioco \u00e8 facile da modificare e ha una comunit\u00e0 di moderatori attiva..
