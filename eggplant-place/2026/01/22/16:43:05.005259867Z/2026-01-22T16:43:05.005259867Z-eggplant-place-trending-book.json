He is whisked away to the mystical Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn magical skills, from potions to spells to flying on broomsticks. But an evil power is rising, the same one that threatened to destroy the entire world when Harry was only a baby. As Harry learns the truth about his family, his childhood, and his mysterious lightning-bolt-shaped scar, he finds unforgettable friendship, a loving surrogate family, and the courage to face the darkest force ever to menace the wizarding world. These charming and engrossing books bring an intensely detailed and captivating world to life and are perfect for enjoying individually or reading aloud."}], "cover_image_url": "https://eggplant.place/m/item/goodreads/2025/01/24/5f40e7c8-dca1-44e5-be0f-b9b222478df3.jpg", "rating": null, "rating_count": 4, "rating_distribution": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "tags": [], "brief": "Harry has been burdened with a dark, dangerous and seemingly impossible task: that of locating and destroying Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes.
